I could find many examples in XAML of how to do it but none have demonstrated it in C# code-behind. I gave it a few attempts but always hit a wall... Could someone please help me understand how i make groups in code-behind when my DataGrid.ItemsSource is a List of Objects?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
