AFAICT from the source code I would at least lose ToolTip functionality, and probably a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould it be possible to modify future versions of the Ribbon to use an IRibbonCommand interface (that derived from ICommand)? That way I could create my own command implementation that wasn't a RoutedCommand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI presume the licence for the current CTP prevents me modifying the code and shipping the modified version, right? Otherwise I'll try making the modification myself.<br>\r\n",
