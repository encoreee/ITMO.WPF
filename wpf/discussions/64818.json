And there are some which do not have it.</p>\r\n<p>A closer inspection showed that styles where the thumbs have animation are &quot;trigger based&quot;.<br>Or opposite: all styles using VSM (like RainierOrange or Daves-Glossy for an example) do not have animation on thumbs.</p>\r\n<p>Any idea why the thumb states do not work?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>Manfred</p>",
