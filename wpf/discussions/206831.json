The main sticking point we have at the moment is that we have no real NumericUpDown control for WPF (our system is very number oriented, so we have a lot of these).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have been searching the discussions here for 'NumericUpDown' and 'Spinner', and a few hits came up from 6-12 months ago saying that there would be one coming out 'shortly' with the ribbon control. Allthough i had a look through the latest code and can't find any classes relating to a ribbon or numericupdown control. I was just wandering what happened to these plans?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I currently have a working version that i created myself, however my problem is that it looks but-ugly. I really need a theme that will look the same as the WinForms NumericUpDown in both XP and Vista (in whatever theme).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone know of anywhere that has a free numeric up down (preferable open-source) that has a theme matching the Winforms one?</p>",
