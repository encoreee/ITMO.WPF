I couldn't find any property on the DataGrid which told me this but I did find two private methods called <span style=\"font-size:11pt;line-height:115%;font-family:'calibri','sans-serif'\">HasRowValidationError<span>&nbsp; </span>/ HasCellValidationError&nbsp;</span> so I changed these to be protected so I could access them from my inherited control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize this will have upgrade issues any advice on alternatives? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks \r\n",
