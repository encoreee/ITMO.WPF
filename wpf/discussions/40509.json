I dynamically add the columns depending on the scenario.<br>\r\nThe issue is when there are less number of columns datagrid displays an additonal column. <br>\r\nThe frustrating part is on the click of the item area in the additional area the column doesnt get selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan any one tell me how to work around this issue. I know the * approcah but it has its own issues <br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#2b91af\"><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=38679\">http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=38679</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help is highly appreciated</span>\r\n",
