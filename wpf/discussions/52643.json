The horizontal scrollbar shall only be visible for the second grid. when scrolling this scrollbar in the second grid, the first grid should scroll too.<br>\r\nI implemented this with two Scrollviewers, but the performance is going down, because the grid takes three times longer to do the databinding.<br>\r\nAnd I cannot scroll the scrollviewer with the mouseweel when I am over the grid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there a way to bind the first grids Scrollbar to the one of the second grid and hide the scrollbar of the first grid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

I mean this little buttons at the sides of the scrollbar, where you can see the little arrows on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your suggestion is a good one too. I did not think about the possibility that the user can use the mouse to navigate inside of the grid! There should be a binding for this too. Otherwise the grids wouldn't have the same columns visible anymore. Thanks.\r\n",
