I find lot's of tricks to get a value from a cell but not to set a value to&nbsp;a cell.</p>\r\n<p>In my case I have a DataGrid and one of the columns contains a path to a document. Via a&nbsp;DataGridTemplateColumn I added a button in each row. The click_event of the button opens the OpenFileDialog and I would like store the selected path of the OpenFileDialog in a specifique cell of the currentrow. Is there a way to realise this?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I'm using the latest version of WPF Toolkit.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Dani&euml;l&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#a31515\"></span></p>",
