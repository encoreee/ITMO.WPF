I'm also new to WPF so I'm not even sure how to add content below the ribbon. Putting content into a grid put's it underneath the ribbon, guess i'll have to define 1st row the same size as the ribbon. Is their a more intutive way? Also can I define a page into a row or something, having the ribbon as a fixed header while the main view might change.</p>\r\n<p>If not is there any other good way to style out a program like that. Fixed navigation bar, somehting that looks good like the ribbon controls.</p>",
