I am trying to implement a custom editor for dates to use it in a propertygrid.<br>\r\nMy DatePickerEditor worked fine until I tried to set the IsEnabled state through binding:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;TK:DatePicker x:Name=&quot;PART_editor&quot;<br>\r\n                       SelectedDate=&quot;{Binding Value, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}&quot;<br>\r\n                       IsEnabled=&quot;{Binding IsEditable}&quot; /&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Did that for a custom string editor as well and there it worked without problems.
