I solved a very similar issue (custom logic when certain keys were pressed while in edit mode) by changing the EditingElementStyle and adding a PreviewKeyDown event handler to the textbox in (actually a class deriving from) DataGridTextColumn. Maybe something similar can work for you as well.</p>",
