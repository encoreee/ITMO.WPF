However, I'm kind of unsure how to go about doing the following:</p>\r\n<p>I want to display several series one the same chart -&gt; this is OK.</p>\r\n<p>I want the legend to display a checkbox next to each legend item -&gt; this is OK, bit messy though.</p>\r\n<p>When the user clicks on the checkbox, the series should disappear (unchecked) or re-appear -&gt; this is OK</p>\r\n<p>When a series disappears, it would be good to get the axis to update with their new relative min / max values for the current <em>visible </em>series data.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is this possible? Could anyone suggest something, or perhaps i'm going about this completely wrong - any better ideas?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pete.</p>",
