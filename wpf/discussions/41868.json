    "Html": "There isn't a super easy solution for this as the DataGrid has a concept of cell editing and row editing.  If you don't need the cell/row edit transaction functionality, then it's probably easier to use a ListView and implement IECV.  I'm guessing that you would rather not use a ListView so I think what you can do is listen to the beginningedit and celleditinending events and set all the cells to editmode and also make sure to cancel cell commits when you are still editing the row.  There are quite a few moving parts there so there may be other things you will have to consider, but it's a starting point.  \r\n",
