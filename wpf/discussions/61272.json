When I user tries to change settings set I must check if the current settings was changed and if it is I have to show message box with confirmation. That's why I have to hook the event SelectionChanging but WPF DataGrid provides only event SelectionChanged. How&nbsp; can I solve my problem?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Alexander Tokarenko</p>",
