They are using MVVM/WPF/Prism.</p>\r\n<p>I have a hard time instanciating objects. I have downloaded and finished all the exercices about Unit here,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=4f8cd377-5522-4f45-a024-44a6ca5111ec\">\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=4f8cd377-5522-4f45-a024-44a6ca5111ec</span></a></p>\r\n<p>but I still don't know how objects are beeing instanciated.&nbsp;Currently I &quot;see&quot; container.registertype as registering the type. But no &quot;values&quot; are passed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now in this project there is something similar to this:</p>\r\n<p>[SearchNavigationViewModel.vb]</p>\r\n<p>Public Sub New(ByVal view As IView, _ <br>\r\n&nbsp;ByVal container As IUnityContainer, _ <br>\r\n&nbsp;ByVal rM As IRM, _ <br>\r\n&nbsp;ByVal DSet As DataSet, _&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;ByVal searchService As Services.ISearchService,&nbsp;&nbsp;ByVal eventAggregator As IEventAggregator)</p>\r\n<p>There is no direct call to the New() function in the solution. <br>\r\nDid a &quot;Find&quot; for &quot;New SearchNavigationViewModel(&quot; and it returns nothing</p>\r\n<p>Instead I am told that the &quot;Container&quot; replaces this. <br>\r\nI do a search for &quot;SearchViewModel&quot; and I look for results with &quot;Container&quot; in it.</p>\r\n<p>I get the following results:</p>\r\n<p>SearchModule.vb(75):&nbsp; Me._container.RegisterType(Of ISearchNavigationViewModel, SearchNavigationViewModel)(New ContainerControlledLifetimeManager())<br>\r\nSearchViewModel.vb(60):&nbsp;Me.SearchNavigationViewModel = _container.Resolve(Of ISearchNavigationViewModel)()</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nI see a &quot;Register&quot; and I see a &quot;Resolve&quot;. I don't see any of those passing the mandatory parameters of the New.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe it's because the _container is passed as a parameter in the New() of SearchModule. Maybe it's done previously.</p>\r\n<p>Do a search for &quot;SearchModule&quot; and I look for results with &quot;Container&quot; or &quot;New SearchModule(&quot; in it. I get results but I don't see a new or a container.</p>\r\n<p>What do I do now ?</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way I can find out who instanciates &quot;&nbsp;SearchNavigationViewModel.vb&quot; ? What are the advantages of using the &quot;Unity Container&quot; instead of calling the New directly ?</p>\r\n<p>What is the purpose of passing datatypes instead of passing the actual value required as a parameter in the New() ? I am not convinced about this &quot;container&quot; thing it's a tomato tom-ato thing if you ask me. both are the same but one is &quot;straight-forward&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I think I need to be enlightened because I doubt that there are no advantages to this container.registertype thingy....</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
