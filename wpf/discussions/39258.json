I made a first sample (connecting our Oracle database) with &quot;Visual Web Developer 2008 Express Edition&quot; and it worked fine.<br>\r\nThen I tried to make the same using WPF for the Web. I installed Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition,  installed the WPF toolkit, made a new &quot;WPF Browser Application&quot; project, dropped the WPF DataGrid and now I would like to set the data source. But I can only add &quot;Access&quot; and &quot;SQL Server&quot; databases in the Database Explorer. Is it a limitation of the Express edition?<br>\r\nThanks in advance for your help!<br>\r\nAnyball \r\n",
