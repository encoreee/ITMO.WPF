    "Html": "Is there a way to localize the DateTimePicker class. The date's are shown in the correct date format. But if de DateTime class is not set, a watermark text is shown. The text is 'show calender' and I can't find a way to change it (other than to recompile it all). We make software for several european countries, each in thier own language. So I need a way to change the text for each locale.<br>\r\nI see several options : <br>\r\n-    Localizable resources to be adjusted with LocBaml or preferably something better ;-).<br>\r\n-    A way to override the string parts in the internal resourcemanager (RS.CS)<br>\r\n-    Make Watermark public, so we can intialize it with a value of our own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there a workaround or should I add an issue tracker item?\r\n",
