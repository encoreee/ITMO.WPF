    "Html": "<p>Hi,<br>\r\nFirst thank you for your quick response.</p>\r\n<p>In the CTP version this did work as you describe.  In the V1 release however this no longer works.   If I remove the ItemsPanel on my V1 DataGrid, I can see all of my rows.  If I roll back to the CTP DataGrid and set the ItemsPanel to use a regular StackPanel, I can see all of my rows.</p>\r\n<p>On that side note:<br>\r\nThe problem with the VirtualizingStackPanel may really be an issue with the DataGridRowsPresenter and not the underlying VirtualizingStackPanel.  When attempting to style the DataGrid I want the ScrollContentPresenter to have a HorizontalAlignment of Left, so anything in the ScrollContentPresenter with be left aligned instead of stretched to the entire width of the ScrollContentPresenter.  The DataGridRowsPresenter does align to the left as expected but there is a tiny &quot;extra&quot; column added to the right side of the DataGrid.  If I resize my last column, making it larger by dragging it ot the right, it covers this &quot;extra&quot; column.  If I again resize my last column making it smaller that &quot;extra&quot; column now stays the width that my last column was before I made it smaller.  Interacting with the DataGrid by dragging and dropping a row makes that &quot;extra&quot; column snap back to it's original size.  I don't want to see this &quot;extra&quot; column at all, it doesn't line up with the DataGridColumnHeadersPresenter and just looks bad from a design standpoint.  We got around this display issue in the CTP by changing the ItemsPanel for the DataGrid to a regular StackPanel, which now, does not work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKindest Regards,<br>\r\n-LT</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi LT,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is nothing to do with stuff getting moved to Primitives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDataGridCellsPanel (the panel which arranges the cells within a row) needs scroll information inorder to measure and arrange and if not available it cannot do anything resulting into an empty DataGrid. If ScrollViewer's CanContentScroll is True, DataGridCellsPanel gets the scroll info from ScrollContentPresenter. Else it gets the scroll info from ScrollViewer (which is logical). Now the problem is DataGrid Template definition sets the CanContentScroll to True by default, because we are using VSP by default which can handle scrolling. But that doesnt work with StackPanel, because it cannot handle scroll. Hence the solution with StackPanel is to override this default value to False.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to set the Value of CanContentScroll to true, then you should create your own panel which implements interface IScrollInfo or use an existing panel which implements it (like VSP).\r\n",
