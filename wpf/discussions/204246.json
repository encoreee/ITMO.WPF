I'm opening a view with 3 tabs, each tab contains an instance of the DataGrid, for some reason, the grid on the first tabs header and rows render totally blank, but I know the items are there as I see the alternating colors. If I put a 4th empty tab to start with, it renders fine once I switch tabs, but that seems impractical. Is this a known bug or is there a workaround? I also tried attaching a debugger with the toolkit source to see if any exceptions were being thrown, but it didn't seem any were.</p>",
