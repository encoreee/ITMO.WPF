Now I need to darken the X-Axis and Y-Axis (passing through (0,0)). Currently, when we set gridlines visibilty to true, we get many lines at equal intervals, I need to darken or highlight the ones passing through the center of chart (0,0). Any suggestions on how to proceed?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Super</p>",
