I can write the SPROC to pull the exact data I need while translating at the server lvl...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah ha!!!...</p>\r\n<p>SO in the end I used the database to do the work of presenting the correct data without having extra overhead to make the datagrid show no more than I needed!&nbsp; And modified my datamodel accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also I am doing this via MVVM pattern and using a framework that Sacha Barber developed.</p>",
