I wasn't able to remove(set to transparent) that white background under column headers(grids background is transparent and that gray textured background is applied to whole form).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://img236.imageshack.us/my.php?image=skinnedgriddb8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://img236.imageshack.us/img236/8726/skinnedgriddb8.th.jpg\" alt=\"Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us\" border=0></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really need to remove that so if anybody can help me please. I was trying to edit the sources but still no result (i'm not skilled enough i think). And it will be also nice to enable other developers to skin even this part.<br>\r\nI haven't got through there but i think the same applies to the row headers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks Jan Dryk<br>\r\n",

I analyzed it&nbsp;with Snoop (by the way:&nbsp;great tool)&nbsp;and came to the conclusion that there is a gray button under the header controls. In snoop you can see the following (partial) visual tree:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- DataGrid<br>\r\n&nbsp; - Border<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - ScrollViewer<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Grid<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Button (with a gray background)<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Grid<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Border (Rectangle)<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Arrow (Polygon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also found out that setting another theme changes the appearance (As you would expect it). <br>\r\nIt seems to me that the class&nbsp;DataGridHeaderBorder has something to do with that: It draws the background depending on the theme.<br>\r\nUnfortunately I couldn't figure out if you can set that background to &quot;Transparent&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope that helps&nbsp;a little anyway.<br>\r\nMichael\r\n",
