The problem I'm having is if they are specifying a filter value on a column that is beyond the initial view, ie: where they had to scroll to see the column, and they choose a value that produces no results, the scrollbars disappear and the grid scrolls itself back to the beginning. These 2 features combined make it impossible for the user to then choose that column and remove or choose a valid value because they can't scroll to see the column anymore. Is there a workaround or is this planned to be fixed?</p>",
