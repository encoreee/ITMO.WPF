I have a ribbon tab under which i have 8 ribbon toggle buttons. 5 buttons appear horizontally and 3 appear vertically. I want all of them to appear horizontally. How do i do that ?</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, if i add one more ribbon toggle button, all 9 ribbon toggle buttons appear horizonatlly. If i remove one as i need only 8 ribbon toggle buttons, 5 buttons appear horizontally and 3 appear vertically.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Bhupesh.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Bhupesh,</p>\r\n<p>Ribbon has standard templates for laying out the controls in a group depending on how many controls are in the group.&nbsp; In the case of an 8 button group, the standard templates are L,L,L,L,L,M,M,M for the largest layout, L,L,M,M,M,M,M,M for the medium size, and L,L,M,M,M,S,S,S for the smallest.&nbsp; You can easily override this behavior using a RibbonGroupSizeDefinition, like so:</p>\r\n<p>&lt;Ribbon.Resources&gt;<br>&lt;RibbonGroupSizeDefinitionCollection x:Key=&quot;Custom8Button&quot;&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonGroupSizeDefinition&gt; &lt;!-- Control sizes: L,L,L,L,L,L,L,L --&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonControlSizeDefinition ImageSize=&rdquo;Large&rdquo; IsLabelVisible=&rdquo;True&rdquo;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/RibbonGroupSizeDefinition&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonGroupSizeDefinition IsPopup=&quot;True&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Collapsed --&gt;<br>&lt;/RibbonGroupSizeDefinitionCollection&gt;<br>&lt;/Ribbon.Resources&gt;</p>\r\n<p>...</p>\r\n<p>&lt;RibbonGroup SizeDefinitions=&rdquo;{StaticResource Custom8Button}&rdquo;&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton&nbsp;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton /&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton&nbsp;/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RibbonButton /&gt;<br>&lt;/RibbonGroup&gt;</p>\r\n<p>Note that in the above example, I've only defined 2 states for my group: the large state with all 9 buttons horizontally and the collapsed state, where the buttons appear in a popup.&nbsp; If you wanted to achieve the collapse behavior on resize which you find in Office, you'll want to define additional RibbonGroupSizeDefinitions with other layouts of the controls.&nbsp; If you want to learn more about customizing Ribbon's control layout and resize behavior, I'd recommend the following resources:</p>\r\n<p>Ribbon Feature Walkthrough <a href=\"http://windowsclient.net/wpf/wpf35/wpf-35sp1-ribbon-walkthrough.aspx\">http://windowsclient.net/wpf/wpf35/wpf-35sp1-ribbon-walkthrough.aspx</a><br>Ribbon Hands on Lab <a href=\"http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/hands-on-labs/default.aspx\">http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/hands-on-labs/default.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>Samantha</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Bhupesh,</p>\r\n<p>I think you should be able to create and apply a GroupSizeDefinition from the code behind at runtime.&nbsp; Or if you know the general range of how many buttons there might be, you can define the GroupSizeDefinitionCollection for each number of controls in XAML&nbsp;and then just apply the right one at runtime.&nbsp; Also, if I remember correctly, I think the GroupSizeDefinitions are actually pretty robust, so you might be able to get away with just using one GroupSizeDefinition if you always want it to look the same regardless of how many controls there are.&nbsp; For example, if you always wanted all buttons to be displayed Large in the first layout and the second layout is collapsed, you could use the GroupSizeDefinitionCollection defined above and just add more ControlSizeDefinitions until you have the same number of ControlSizeDefinitions as the maximum number of buttons (any extra ControlSizeDefinitions should be ignored in the case that you don't have the max number of controls in the group).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>Samantha</p>",
