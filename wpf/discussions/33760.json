I've played with the grouping capability and it works really well, but that still leaves us to build our own drag and drop header so that the user can easily drive this functionality. Is this planned as something that will be added in future CTP's, or do we all have to roll our own?\r\n",

What is your expectation on this? Would you want to affect the ordering of the underlying data or are you thinking of this only at the view level? At this time we do not have plans for support this feature. However we will certainly keep this in mind for the future.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Thanks</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Varsha (MSFT)</span></p>\r\n</span>\r\n",

With column sorting, you have provided the UI component, so there is some inconsistency here too, although it would be nice if the sorting was tri-state, where the third state is unsorted or original order.\r\n",

The additional UI allowing users to drag drop column headers to do grouping is certainly a nice feature to have. However for the first version of the WPF DataGrid we do not propose to implement this out-of-the-box. As for tri-state sorting, weâ€™ll consider that too for a future release. Thanks for letting us know your views on all these features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nVarsha (MSFT)</span></p>\r\n",
