The grid ended showing a gray gap at the bottom (This gap is definitely part of the datagrid, as I checked the visual tree using Snoop). The height of this gap is exactly the difference between normal row and smaller-font rows multiplied the number of smaller-font rows.<br>\r\nIt's as if the the grid calculated the area needed to show its rows by calculating standard row height x number of rows.<br>\r\nHow can I fix this?<br>\r\n",
