Is there any opportunity to hide the legend on the right side of the linechart.</p>\r\n<p>2.) Can I use custom labels for the values of the Y axis. I have only 3 values which are possible (High, Moderate and Normal). Currently I bind the DependentValueBinding to a Integer property (possible values 1,2,3). So the labels on the left side of the Y axis are 1,2,3. If I bind the DependentValueBinding to a enumeration property the chart doesn't work.</p>\r\n<p>- So is there any opportunity to bind the DependentValueBinding to an property of an enumeration type (enum Type { Normal = 1, PriceType.Moderate = 2, PriceType.High=3 } )&nbsp; ?</p>\r\n<p>- Or is there any opportunity to bind to an integer property but set the Labels of the Y axis to (Normal for 1, Moderate for 2, High for 3)</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for help</p>",
