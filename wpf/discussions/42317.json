Our current thinking is that if we do decide to have a ribbon in our UI, we will need to buy a third party component.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nJames<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Thanks for the info, Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's particularly interesting that RibbonCommand will (probably) be going away. It might be useful to mention this fairly prominently somewhere, as converting XAML with RibbonCommands to XAML with the properties on the controls isn't trivial (I've tried to do the opposite when I inherited a prototype that had been built using an eval copy of the the Actipro Ribbon). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBTW, if you look at my other recent posts you'll see that I've been concerned about how to hook up RibbonCommands to existing ICommand instances, so if RibbonCommand is going away then I guess my problems there will go away with it. :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks again,<br>\r\nJames<br>\r\n",
