One column's values are decimal, some have fraction and some do not have fraction (12.34 or 45.00). What I need to do is to show them differently, like 12.34 (with fraction) or 45 (without fraction).</p>\r\n<p>I tried to do it by creating a custom ValueConverter. But when I tried to change the format cell by cell, I got the exception said &quot;binding cannot be changed after it has been used&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone know how to solve it or other way to achive this goal?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>",
