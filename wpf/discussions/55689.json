    "Html": "<p>Hi All,<br><br>I am on the latest version of the datagrid and trying to enter edit mode programatically when the grid receive focus from tabbing from another control.</p>\r\n<p>I am trying to achieve using the form without using the mouse. The user has to tab through 3 text boxes then onto the grid. For the text boxes I handled the PreviewKeyDown event, checked for the Enter key and give focus to the next text box (if it was the Enter key) and swalling the enter key. This is all 100% until I give focus to the grid from the 3rd text box. The grid gets focus, but I still need to select the first row/cell with the mouse to begin editing.<br><br>So question is... How to programatically enter edit mode on the first editable cell in a grid when it receives focus.<br><br>TIA</p>",
