I'm using the October 2008 version of the Datagrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have compared this with the performace of a hosted Winforms Datagrid which is way better!&nbsp; The Winforms Datagrid is actually usable, although to have custom header templates and a frozen column i will need to extend the default Winforms Datagrid which I'm not very keen on doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have also compared the performance with the free Xceed grid, which handles much worse that the WPF Toolkit's Datagrid.&nbsp; The Infragistics WPF grid was the only free one that could easily handle 1000 columns by 5000 rows with a complete usable interface, although again it does not support a frozen column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny tips on boosting performance on the WPF Toolkit grid?<br>\r\n",
