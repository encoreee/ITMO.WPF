Ive been going round in circles trying to achieve this.  WindowsClient.net suggests this is easy by using blend to edit the control templates but I have not been able to do this successfully. Ultimately Im trying to achieve a similar look to the Expresion Dark style for the calendar used in the silverlight toolkit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

If i add an x:Key to the Calendar and CalendarItem styles i can modifiy these but i am struggling to get anything to work with CalendarDayButton and CalendarButton styles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help whatsoever would be appreciated.<br>\r\n",

I've been trying in VS mainly, but had a go at doing it in Blend. I have copied the generic style into my resources and added the various xml name spaces to both that and my window, but still no luck. Like you say WindowsClient shows an example, and just brushes over the fact that there is a designer for VS and Blend. I cannot find anywhere on the web about how to style the calendar control, or how to integrate the designer Dales to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just thought I'd show a little solidarity rather than just waiting for someone to reply to your thread. Also hopefully the more people who are having this problem, the more likely its going to get answered.\r\n",

Fingers crossed on someone being able to give some insight into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you add a front end to the WPFToolkit source and change the generic.xaml theme you can get a peek of what your calendar control could look like. How frustrating!<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi devman81 &amp; dpgregory - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would be more than happy to help you both with your Styling issues. First off, Blend will not get you as far as you would like in this instance because of how the Control was designed. You will have to use the Style Properties exposed by the Controls rather applying implicit Styles. If you copy all the Styles from the Toolkit source (in generic.xaml) and modify them however you please then assign them each an  x:key, you can assign the Styles to the Style Properties of the Control.<br>\r\nFor example: <span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#0000ff\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;ms:Calendar <br>\r\nStyle=&quot;{StaticResource BlueCal}&quot; <br>\r\nCalendarItemStyle=&quot;{StaticResource RedCalItem}&quot; <br>\r\nCalendarDayButtonStyle=&quot;{StaticResource GreenCalDayButton}&quot;<br>\r\nCalendarButtonStyle=&quot;{StaticResource PurpleCalButton}&quot;/&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span>Hopefully this response proves helpfull. Please let us know if you have any further difficulties - we want to make you can Style these Controls :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Eric, MSFT\r\n",
