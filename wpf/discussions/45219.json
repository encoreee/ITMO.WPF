    "Html": "Hi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately MouseLeave / MouseEnter are not routed events so do not traverse up and down the visual tree. This means that you would have to provide an event handler for each cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could manually detect enter/ / leave. If you handle the MouseMove event on the grid itself, the event arguments contains an OriginalSource property. If you inspect the visual tree starting at this element, you will see that you can travel up the tree to find the cell that the mouse is currently over. Take a look at this blog post for a few more details:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhttp://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/wpf/2008/12/wpf-datagrid-detecting-clicked-cell-and-row/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this technique, you should be able to work ou for yourself when the mouse has entered / left a cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope that helps,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nColin E.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nhttp://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/wpf/ - my WPF blog<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFDataGridExamples.aspx - WPF DataGrid Practical Examples <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n",
