It works just fine if I use a listview, but if I change it to a datagrid it stopps fireing and just gives me a: &quot;Cannot find source for binding with reference 'ElementName=MyView'. BindingExpression:Path=DataContext.MyDelegateCommand; DataItem=null; target element is 'Button' (Name=''); target property is 'Command' (type 'ICommand')&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Please send me an answer if you have found any solution to this!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>/hannes</p>",
