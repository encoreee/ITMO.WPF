This led me to an idea that control styles could have them written in more generic way like this:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background=&quot;{Binding Source={StaticResource ColorManager}, Path=[ButtonBackground-LightDark]}&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The next question that I wanted to answer is what other function are there to manipulate or compare colors and create palettes and what is the good way to visualize palette creation.</p>\r\n<p>Any advice if this color manipulation function and color wheel control maybe added to this or similar projects?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
