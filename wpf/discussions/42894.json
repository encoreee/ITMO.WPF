I can easily set the background property as I wish. however at the end of the toolbar there is a so small thumb which is used to show &quot;Add Or Remove Buttons&quot; which appears to be a standard feature of toolbar controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am unable to style this. The background style doesn't take effect on this portion of the toolbar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anyone how to style this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr as an alternative disable this so it doesnt show up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you<br>\r\n~Pradeep<br>\r\n",
