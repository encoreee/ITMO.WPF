It seems to me that all of these products are evolving but I'm confused as to which technogy would best meet my needs. I thought the WPF Application framework was pretty good but now I see this and it's yet another toolkit. \r\n\r\nWho supports this toolkit, is it something I should seriously consider, does it use PRISM, does it use MEF, does it use Entity Framework and does it come with good working samples. \r\n\r\nSome advice from anyone out there would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\nthanks,",
