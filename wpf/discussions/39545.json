    "Html": "<p>Hi warriors89,</p>\r\n<p>Could you explain your scenario a little further?  The reason I ask is because we had considered at one point adding a SelectionMode=None feature, but we had trouble thinking of a compelling customer scenario where selection would be disabled.  In most scenarios, having a read-only grid was sufficient and even with a read-only grid, selection was desired so that users could copy or highlight data while reading.  This is a feature which we could consider adding in V2, so I'd like to understand why your application requires that the user can't select anything.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Samantha</p>\r\n",

But instead I want a context-menu, giving me the choice of: Add new row, Edit row, Delete row. And when I choose the Edit row I want that row to go into edit mode and highlight as selected row. Right now when a right-click a row for the context-menu that row gets selected, and that's not very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also have readonly list I want to show, could do that with ListView but lot's of goodies built in to the DataGrid so why not use that instead. Right now I change the background color of the row when hovering over it, so for me there is no need to mark a readonly row as selected. When I click the row an detailview window would be opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus Gladh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
