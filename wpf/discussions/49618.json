In MainWindow.xaml.vb I have a Public Sub New() where I do the most of initialisation, but the WPF-Window is not yet visible an so I don't get the Handle. In VB6 there was a place called OnShow where the window was initialized completely but not visible andÂ had already a handle. Where is the place in the code to be able to get the handle an the WPF-Window is not yet shown?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help appreciated.<br>\r\nRegards<br>\r\nCarsten\r\n",
