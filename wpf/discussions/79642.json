Create simple sparkline chart as seen in the silverlight sample.</p>\r\n<p>2. Bind it to an observable collection.</p>\r\n<p>3. Add 50 elements to observable collection.</p>\r\n<p>4. Clear Collection.</p>\r\n<p>When I clear the collection, the chart clears, but 50 LineDataPoints remain in the Canvas &quot;PlotArea&quot; as viewed in Wpf Performance Suite. If I add more elements to the chart and clear them, I then have even more LineDataPoints.</p>\r\n<p>What is the proper way to handle this issue?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>*edited horrible grammar*</p>",
