If there is at least one object already in this list, the datagrid will let me add new ones to the bottom, creating a new row as a tab off the end of the last one (aside: perversly setting the selection not to the next new row, but back at the top of the grid!!).</p>\r\n<p>However, if my list is empty (that is, not null, but has zero items in it) then the grid appears with one row. Now when I tab off the end of the row, the grid does not create a new row! Why not? Is this something I need to handle?</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>Nick</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
