I want to be able to set styles up so that the DataGrid automatically uses the default styles given to elements like the TextBox, ComboBox, Checkbox and TextBlock. \r<br />\n<br />\nAs far as I can tell this property is not available to be set in the ResourceDictionary and the only way to override the styles is to set the ElementStyle and EditingElementStyle explicitly per column at the time the DataGrid is generated. \r<br />\n<br />\nI don't want to rely on the development team applying the right styles on every column of a DataGrid - surely there must be a way for it to happen automatically?\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help or guidance appreciated. Thanks<br />\n",
