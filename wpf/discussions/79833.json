I don't mind handling the events on my outer elements, but I can't seem to figure out how to cause a &quot;Select&quot; behavior. Typically I've been causing it by raising the MouseLeftButtonDownEvent on the active DataGridCell, but now that I don't actually have any DataGridCell's, I'm a bit perplexed on how to duplicate that behavior with only access to the DataGridRow.</p>",
