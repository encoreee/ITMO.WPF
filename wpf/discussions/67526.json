We use resgen to build a class that provides static references to the keys as members of a class&nbsp; StringResources in some namespace.&nbsp; I have registered the namespace as &quot;resx&quot; for reference in xaml, and as such I can do this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">r</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">RibbonMenuItem.Command</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n    &lt;r:RibbonCommand LabelTitle=&quot;{x:Static resx:Strings.Ribbon_Label_French}&quot;\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">r</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">RibbonMenuItem.Command</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span>\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>and sure enough, the correct version of the string for whatever the CurrentUICulture is set to when the app starts up is displayed. Yay.</p>\r\n<p>My challenge is to allow the user to change their current culture while the app is running. This I can do, and once I set the CurrentUICulture on the UI thread, sure enough everything that gets rendered from that point uses the right culture.</p>\r\n<p>But, the ribbon doesn't feel the change. It just got the value for these LabelTitle strings once when it was first displayed.</p>\r\n<p>How can I tell the ribbon to refresh these things?</p>\r\n<p>I thought maybe I could do a data binding hack</p>\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">r</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">RibbonMenuItem.Command</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span><br>    &lt;r:RibbonCommand LabelTitle=&quot;{Binding Path=Ribbon_Label_French}&quot;<br><span style=\"color:Blue\">&lt;/</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">r</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">:</span><span style=\"color:#A31515\">RibbonMenuItem.Command</span><span style=\"color:Blue\">&gt;</span><br><br><br>But I get an error because LabelTitle is not a DependencyProperty. That approach would have been pretty cumbersome anyway.<br><br>Is there any way to do this?  <br>What if it weren't a ribbon thing, but just a plain old WPF label, where I had set the content property in this way? <br>I think it is the same problem.<br><br>Thanks<br>roger<br><br></pre>",
