Great work, y'all!</p>\r\n<p>Here's what I have :</p>\r\n<p>A DataGrid with a few Columns, three of which are DataGridComboboxColumns. Two of the columns should have the same Items-Collection, the third one should have it's own. The items are (as of this writing) defined in the Window class.</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:green\">// ObservableCollection&lt;Route&gt;</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> RouteCollection Routes\r\n        {\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">get</span>;\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">set</span>;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:green\">// ObservableCollection&lt;Endpoint&gt;</span>\r\n<span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> EndpointCollection Endpoints\r\n        {\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">get</span>; \r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">set</span>;\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n<pre>I wouldn't like to do something like creating dependency properties from those collections and setting this.DataContext = this...it seems rather dirty to do this...</pre>\r\n<pre>Could anyone help me out with an idea? Is there a best practice that describes a better way of doing this?</pre>\r\n<pre>Next thing, I can't seem to&nbsp;add a DataGridComboboxColumn.ItemTemplate node. Is this a Text-Only Column-Type? Will I have to go for a DataGridTemplateColumn if I want to customize Item layout?</pre>\r\n<pre>Any help appreciated!</pre>\r\n<pre>Thanks in advance</pre>\r\n</div>",
