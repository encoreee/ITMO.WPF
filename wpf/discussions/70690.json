It does recognise a MouseOver and is able to highlight the row when the cursor is inside it, but the row doesn't select if you click.</p>\r\n<p>I don't want to set the width of the last column to be * as it will look very odd with our data. I need the columns to only be as wide as the data inside them.</p>\r\n<p>I can get around it by adding a dummy column at the end with Width=&quot;*&quot; but this is not an elegant solution.</p>\r\n<p>Am I missing something here? Any help appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
