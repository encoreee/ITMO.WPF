What is the best practice for doing that?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;When setting the values on the axis, how could I make the value looks like&nbsp; &pound;15&nbsp;m or &pound; 15 bn&nbsp;displayed on the&nbsp;axis rather than just numbers?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. The User need to right click on the chart and be able to save the chart as a image on the local machine. Is it possible to do it?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>4. After getting the minmium value and maximum value of the axis, what is the best practice to calcualte the interval and display the values on the axis more friendly? e.g. display values of 500, 550, 600 rather than 112, 115, 121</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Different legend symbol, not just different color? e.g. Corlor red with Square symbol, Color yellow with Triangle symbol</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
