    "Html": "<p>Hi Graeme,</p>\r\n<p>I don't think there is a difference between Autocomplete and SuggestBox.&nbsp; The reason we have two different names is because Autocomplete is (as you suspected) going be a port of the Silverlight Autocomplete control.&nbsp; I don't believe we have a timeline set for this yet, but it should be within the next few months.&nbsp; The SuggestBox is an old standalone sample which we have internally and need to clean up and release.&nbsp; We&nbsp;added this control to the Roadmap&nbsp;before we knew that the Silverlight Toolkit&nbsp;had&nbsp;Autocomplete in the works, so I think what will end up happening is that we'll just release the Autocomplete control and toss the SuggestBox, since Autocomplete is superior quality control.&nbsp; I'll update the Futures Roadmap and remove the SuggestBox to reflect this.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!<br>Samantha</p>",
