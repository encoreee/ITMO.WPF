I want to be able to create a Ribbon Window (that would work as a shell) with Ribbon tabs (which are not a module but rather a static element of a shell) and be able to load modules depending on the tab that is selected by the user. I wrote and application in prism, then tried to migrate it into an application using Ribbon but got all kind of errors. Is there a good example that could teach me how to do that properly?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any help.</p>",
