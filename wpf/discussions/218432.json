I started to use the datagrid in System.Windows.Controls but now I see there is a datagrid in the Windows Toolkit. \r\n\r\nShould I consider using the toolkit version, does it fix any bugs or add new features? How about if I start using this version, is it likely that I will have problems when they role out a new version of the datagrid in .Net next ?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n",
