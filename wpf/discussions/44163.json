    "Html": "<p>Hi Erich27,</p>\r\n<p>I believe that the RibbonControlGroups in Word's Font group are actually the same height (1/3 of the group height) as other standard small-sized controls, but they're laid out differently.  If you resize Word's window to be narrower so that the Font group collapses, you'll see that the control groups stay the same height, but there are now 3 rows.  I believe that this specific height is required by the Office Fluent UI Licensing Guidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to achieve the same sort of layout as in the Font group, you'll need to write a custom layout panel to handle that and replace the standard RibbonWrapPanel with it.  Your panel should also contain logic to have similar resizing behavior to Word (where the control groups jump around as the groups get smaller).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\nSamantha</p>\r\n",
