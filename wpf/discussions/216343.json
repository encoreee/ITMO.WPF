Further, if it is the RibbonTabPanel, the tabs will move to either the left or the right if the corresponding cursor key is pressed. The hands-on-lab Ribbon example does the same.</p>\r\n<p>Does anybody know a way around this?</p>\r\n<p>I have tried setting focus away from the ribbon at appropriate times.&nbsp;Neither the RibbonTabPanel nor the RibbonGroupPanel can be accessed directly so I have instead&nbsp;tried ensuring the focus is not on a control which does still require it (such as QuickAccessToolbar, ApplicationMenu, RibbonDropDownButtons, text input elements or comboboxes) first, however I have been unsuccessful&nbsp;with this. For one thing, once the ApplicationMenu has been accessed,&nbsp;ApplicationMenu.IsKeyboardFocusedWithin returns true even&nbsp;after I click in a textbox within the Ribbon proper.</p>",
