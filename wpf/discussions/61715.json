    "Html": "<p>Marcin,</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately Charting does NOT currently support gaps in a data set for something like LineSeries. However, it's something we'd like to support in a future release.</p>\r\n<p>For the time being, one thing you might try is to use multiple LineSeries (with the same color) to simulate the same thing by using one for each of your &quot;chunks&quot; of data. This should render as you want (i.e., with gaps), though I totally agree it's more work to set up than it should be.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the feedback - hope this helps!</p>\r\n<p>PS - If you don't mind doing so, opening a work item on the Silverlight Toolkit issue tracker would be a great way to allow others to vote for this which is a great way for us to understand how it ranks against other feature requests. Thanks again!</p>",
