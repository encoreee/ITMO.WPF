However the SelectTemplate method never gets called. If I set this selector as the CellTemplateSelector it does call the SelectTemplate method but passes in null items at the beginning. Is this a known issue? Do I have to do anything else other than simply setting the selector to get the data grid to use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks\r\n",

The CellEditingTemplateSelector is only being used if the CellTemplateSelector was set and the CellTemplate (and CellEditingTemplate) was unset. I think this is a bug as logically the CellTemplate should have no effect on the CellEditingTemplateSelector.\r\n",
