This causes the UI to become unresponsive as soon as a user selects all rows and changes selection again.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any way I can limit the number of rows that a user can select? I.e. show an error message when the selection size is &gt;50,000 and stop the datagrid from loading the row details (if that's what causes the UI to become unresponsive)?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>Steven</p>",
