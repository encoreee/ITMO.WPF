This works.\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span>\r\n<p>But the popup that appears is always of the same width sa that of the parent combobox. I need popup to not expand to the size of the combob but adjust to its underlying contents (a list of names) width. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would I do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting _popup.Width = 80 works for me... but It has 2 problems ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I shouldnt use absolute pixel widths.<br>\r\n2. The border of the popup clips on the right side because actual width of the combox (which is also the width of the popup) can vary and is mostly greater than 80. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan anyone tell me a sophisticated way to auto adjust width of the popup to its content size?<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThx.<br>\r\nVinit.</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n",

I did set the ActualWidth of the underlying contents but that always returns 0.0 So I am not sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now, because my given application only displays the list of names, I assigned a ListBox (which binds itself to the combobox's ItemsSource,  DisplayMemeberPath, SelectedValuePath and SelectedValue and SelectedItem) as _popup.Child.And it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe listbox only fitted to the width of the list and not to that of the combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as of now I have a workaround. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThx for the help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:-)\r\n",
