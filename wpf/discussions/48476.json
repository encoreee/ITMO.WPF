In my application i have aspGridView and the the end of every row i can eaisly put HyperLinkField upon clicking it will take user to next page and displays the detail data of same row using its unique ID. i am wondering if it is possible in WPF DataGrid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\ni have prototype in ASPX page i am afraid there is no option to upload photos. that could have been of better understanding<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n",
