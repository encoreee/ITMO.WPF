    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nI was not able to spot cause of this issue but I think that I've accidentally found walk-around to this problem. In my case it was somehow related to my LineSeries' independent axes. I wanted them to be hidden but simply setting Visibility to Hidden caused this weird shrinking problem. When I've additionally set axis Height property to 0 it suddenly stopped shrinking my chart. <br />\n<br />\nHere's fixed code:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;chartingToolkit:LineSeries.IndependentAxis&gt;\n    &lt;chartingToolkit:DateTimeAxis Orientation=&quot;X&quot; Height=&quot;0&quot; Visibility=&quot;Hidden&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/chartingToolkit:LineSeries.IndependentAxis&gt;</code></pre>\n\n",
