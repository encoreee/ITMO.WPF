I have also a couple of situation where I have to change the cells background to reflect some changes. But, at a certain point I want to reset all the cells/rows background to their initial values. All that is fine, but now when selecting, the selected cells that had the background modified and then reseted (actualy the rows themself ) do no came up with the green background as initialy, is like the selection color is transparent  now. The row/cells that din't had the background chnaged are displayed with green background when selected. Does anybody knows why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn.  \r\n",
