I would like to give my&nbsp;users the ability to check boxes in an added column, so that deletion would be made in batch once they click on a button to validate their changes. Problem is, I only get what is in datacontext, but I am unable to read back that new column. I must be especially dense (I am still quite new at WPF and totally new at using the WPF Toolbox), but even after spending a good chunk of time looking for it everywhere, I have been unable to find a good explanation on how to do what I am trying to.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any pointer.</p>\r\n<p>Bernard</p>",
