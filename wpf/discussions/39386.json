I can trigger an event using the cell style, but can I do something like this for the whole row or I just simply need to attach the cellstyle to each and every column? Some samples would be greatly appreciated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, would be great to see how manipulate the button within the template column.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!\r\n",
