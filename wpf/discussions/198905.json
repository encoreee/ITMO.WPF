I'm using a column series to display this data on a chart (X axis corresponds to day number). What I'd like to do, is to display it such that data for stock &quot;A&quot; shows up first - days 1 through 7, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">followed</span> by data for days 1-7 for stock &quot;B&quot;. I.e. the X asis shows days 1-7 for &quot;A&quot; and then restarts the ticks for &quot;B&quot;.&nbsp; What is currently happening is that I see 2 columns side by side for each day (for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;). <br><br>Is there a way I can make this happen via configuration, or will I need to write my own series etc.?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Priya</p>",
