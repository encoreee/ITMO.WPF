I discovered that users that have NVDA, JAWS or other screen reader technologies installed, they would crash whenever items were added to the DataGrid.\r<br />\n<br />\nAfter searching the net, I found a workaround that seemed like it worked. I created a new derived class and overrode the OnCreateAutomationPeer method, returning null. This stopped the crashes and everything seemed great.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever...this is not acceptable as a fix, because it now stop ALL announcing from within the DataGrid.\r<br />\n<br />\nI created a simple DataGrid and let it generate columns, etc. and I don't get the error. However, when I create a template with several controls within the cells, I start to get the error.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone else found this problem? If so, were you able to find a workaround that did not prevent the screen readers from announcing?\r<br />\n<br />\nLeeland<br />\n",
