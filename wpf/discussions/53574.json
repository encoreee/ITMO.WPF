Maybe someone can help me with the C# for this. I would like to:<br>\r\n1.) Sort on a specific column on start up of the application. (If the user doesn't click a header to sort by, all new items go to the bottom)<br>\r\n2.) From code behind, just sort on a column&nbsp; in some order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n/J<br>\r\n",
