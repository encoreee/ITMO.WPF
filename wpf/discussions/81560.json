I've tried playing around with RequestBringIntoView, like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:Blue\">private</span> <span style=\"color:Blue\">void</span> DataGrid_RequestBringIntoView(<span style=\"color:Blue\">object</span> sender, RequestBringIntoViewEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    e.Handled = <span style=\"color:Blue\">true</span>;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>But that does nothing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Things I've tried:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>My cells are custom UserControls; I tried putting an event handler for RequestBringIntoView on all UserControls that make up my cells, and tried handling the event, thinking that maybe I wasn't doing enough by just handling RequestBringIntoView on the DataGrid itself. This did not work.</li>\r\n<li>Hosted the DataGrid inside of a ScrollViewer, and handled the ScrollViewer's RequestBringIntoView event. This actually works, and stops the auto-scrolling behavior, but in my case hosting a DataGrid inside of a ScrollViewer is not at all desirable, so I need to come up with a different solution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I'm not sure how to stop this behavior, any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> someone suggested <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2064848/wpf-datagrid-how-do-i-stop-auto-scrolling-when-a-cell-is-clicked/2065300#2065300\">this solution</a> to me, but I was unable to get that to work.</p>",
