As the application is large, it would take months to migrate it seamlessly. In the meantime, I want WPF to integrate into the existing UI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I need to style the DataGrid like a traditional DataGridView (default DGV look without any customizations). I have tried but not able to achieve it exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan somebody provide me the styling for the WPF DataGrid to make it look exactly like a traditional DGV?? I believe many people would be able to reuse the styles.<br>\r\n",
