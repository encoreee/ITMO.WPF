What if I have a library consisting of existing ShaderEffects. How do I enable &quot;Effect&quot; build action for the .fx files? I could definitely copy-paste tags from the MSBuild file but I think it can be more easily done if the Effect build action was universal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: I love the fact that I don't have to install DirectX SDK !!<br>\r\n",
