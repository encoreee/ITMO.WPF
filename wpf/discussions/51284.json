However, my problem is that when I click on one of the checkboxes, the first click simply selects the row that the checkbox is on, then it takes another click to check/uncheck the checkbox.</div><div>I can override the style of the DataGridCell in xaml to prevent it showing the blue background when a row is selected, but this doesn't get over the problem of it taking two clicks to check or uncheck a checkbox, because the first one is selecting the row.</div><div>Is there any way of making it so that the rows are 'unselectable', that is, ideally so that the DataGrid has no concept of a 'selected' row, and that clicking on any checkbox will check/uncheck it?</div><div>Thanks</div><div><br></div>",
