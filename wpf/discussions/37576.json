I do not want to propagate the value to the property of the bound object. I want the actual commit of the value change to take place whenever IsEditing changes on the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is my scenario. There's a field in which the user has to input a value that is dictated by a list of valid values. To aid the user, there's the possibility to popup a dialog in which the valid values are presented. The user chooses one of the valid values, and the value in the cell is changed accordingly. When the user tabs out of the cell, the value is commited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DataGridCell.Content gets the visual tree of the cell, either a TextBlock or a TextBox depending on whether the cell is in edit mode or not. I've tried to set the value on the TextBlock and on the TextBox (i.e. switched between IsEditing=True|False and set the value on the current FrameworkElement), but the local value of the cell stays unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the new value to the DataGridCell.Content as proposed at:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=34065\">http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=34065</a><br>\r\ndoesn't work either, as would be expected.\r\n",
