When the window is maximized, the top of the application menu button and QAT buttons are clipped off because they go off the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you let me know if these things are going to be fixed by V1, or if I will need to try to find a way to fix it myself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nAlex\r\n",
