In each cell is a stack panel that contains a check box or a textbox.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any way to get the check box checked (or unchecked) once the user clicks or focuses on a particular cell?  i.e. instead of having to click twice, for the check box to be toggled on one click?\r<br />\n<br />\nSimilarly, once the cell with the textbox is clicked the user should be able to start typing.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance.<br />\n",
