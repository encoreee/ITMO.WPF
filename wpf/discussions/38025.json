    "Html": "I would suggest using row/column definitions in your main grid and making use of the special dynamic size settings (&quot;*&quot; and &quot;Auto&quot;).&nbsp; The &quot;Auto&quot; operator means that the row/column will be as large as it needs to be to accommodate the tallest/widest element in it.&nbsp; The &quot;*&quot; operator means that the row/column will take up the remaining vertical/horizontal space in the grid.&nbsp; You can further modify the &quot;*&quot; operator to give it a fixed percentage of the height/width or combine multiple &quot;*&quot; operators to have them share space equally. You can also use max and min values in conjunction with the &quot;*&quot; operator to get all kinds of interesting behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would highly suggest playing around with these settings until you find the desired behavior for your application.&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the example below the DataGrid should be as tall as the grid that contains it minus the space occupied by the first and third rows.&nbsp; If the DataGrid is too large it will automatically show the scroll bars and give you the behavior you're seeking without pushing the third row out of view.&nbsp; Understanding how these special sizes work and separating your UI into smaller parts should allow you to get a layout that looks good even when the windows change size and uses minimal manual size settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Grid&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;*&quot; MinHeight=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;RowDefinition Height=&quot;Auto&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;StackPanel Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot; &gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;Put stuff here.&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;dg:DataGrid Grid.Row=&quot;1&quot; &gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/dg:DataGrid&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=&quot;2&quot; Text=&quot;This is a footer.&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Grid&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
