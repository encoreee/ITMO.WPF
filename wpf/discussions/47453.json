For the DataGrid, the container is a DataGridRow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave a look at the other methods on dg.ItemContainerGenerator, you might find them useful in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nColin E.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nhttp://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/wpf/ - my WPF blog<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFDataGridExamples.aspx - WPF DataGrid Practical Examples <br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
