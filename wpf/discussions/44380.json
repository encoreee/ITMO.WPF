I'm trying to set the MINWIDTH of the columns to the ACTUAL WIDTH of the GRID. I thought that setting the WIDTH of the COLUMNS to * I would have solved all my problems, but I need also to extend the Column in HORIZONTAL, viewing an HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR. Setting the WIDTH to * this is impossible, and the MinWidth could not be set to *.<br>\r\nI hope anyone could help me in short time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \r\n",
