Hopefully no one finds it inappropriate for these discussion boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am trying to figure out how to encrypt/decrypt the connection string within my WPF application's app.config file. I am most familiar with the methods used for ASP.Net applications, and it seems the libraries are available in .Net itself, but I cannot find an example that works for WPF as aspnet_regiis.exe doesn't seem to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn app.config I have the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;configuration&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;connectionStrings&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;add name=&quot;ConnectionString&quot; connectionString=&quot;<em>WHATEVER DATA HERE</em>&quot; providerName=&quot;Oracle.DataAccess.Client&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/connectionStrings&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/configuration&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anyone know a best practice method for getting this done on the WPF platform?<br>\r\n",
