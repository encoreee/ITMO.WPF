    "Html": "Hi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, you should look at the Generic.xaml within the WPF Toolkit to understand exactly what it is you are styling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a few options ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1) Implicit style on Button - this is probably not what you want? Do you want all your buttons everywhere to look the same?<br>\r\n(2) Change the DataGrid template - this will unfortunately result in a lot of cut and paste code as you will have to reproduce all of the templates / styles that the DataGrid uses.<br>\r\n(3) Handle the Loaded event and style the Button dynamically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is an example of #3 ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandle the Loaded event for your DataGrid as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nprivate void Grid_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DependencyObject dep = sender as DependencyObject;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (!(dep is Button))<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dep = VisualTreeHelper.GetChild(dep, 0);<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Button button = dep as Button;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object res = Resources[&quot;SelectAllButtonTemplate&quot;];<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; button.Template = res as ControlTemplate;<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis method uses VisualTreeHelper to walk the visual tree. We are relying on the knowlegde that Button is the first element, four levels down the tree. If this were not the case, we would need some more sophisticated logic here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the button is found, we cast then style. Here I am setting the control template because the existing template is not the template you would find on an average button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is my template:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;ControlTemplate x:Key=&quot;SelectAllButtonTemplate&quot; TargetType=&quot;{x:Type Button}&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Grid&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;Hi&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Grid&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nColin E.<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nhttp://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/wpf/ - my WPF blog<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFDataGridExamples.aspx - WPF DataGrid Practical Examples <br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
