ComboBoxColumn is bound to one of its table. When I select some item from the ComboBoxColumn,<br>content of other cells (in the same row) is changed from code-behind:</p>\r\n<p>ComboBox cb = (ComboBox)e.OriginalSource;<br>int disciplineID = (Int32)cb.SelectedValue;<br>DataRow dr = dataSet.Tables[&quot;Discipline&quot;].Select(&quot;Discipline_ID=&quot; + disciplineID)[0];<br>DataRowView drv = (DataRowView)dataGrid1.CurrentItem;<br>drv.Row[&quot;Department_ID&quot;] = dr.ItemArray[2];<br>drv.Row[&quot;Department_Name&quot;] = dataSet.Tables[&quot;Department&quot;].Select(&quot;Department_ID=&quot; + dr.ItemArray[2])[0].ItemArray[1];<br>...</p>\r\n<p>The problem: the cells are still empty though their values were changed. But their content display correctly When I<br>double-click on these cells and enter in the edit mode. After that clicked cells will work right - their<br>content remains visible and changing in accordance with the item selected in the ComboBox of ComboBoxColumn.<br>Can somebody help me to solve this problem?</p>",
