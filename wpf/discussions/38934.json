Because of this we dynamically add new DataGridTemplateColumns runtime (with a DataTemplate as CellTemplate), either by building XAML-strings and parsing them with XamlReader or alternatively by using FrameworkElementFactory to build the datatemplates.</div><div><br></div><div>We also set EnableColumnVirtualization to true, but do not know the consequences of this.</div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Our problem</span> is that when the number of columns reach 250, the hit on performance is quite unacceptable (10 seconds+ just to build the columns). Populating an already built grid with new rows is not a problem.</div><div><br></div><div>Any ideas on alternative solutions?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",
