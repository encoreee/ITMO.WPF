    "Html": "Hello,<br />\n<br />\nI'm using the Chart to build a graph at runtime based on user input.  This amounts to me creating one to many LineSeries and adding them to (or removing them from) the chart's Series collection.<br />\n<br />\nThis much is working great.<br />\n<br />\nI've got requirements to only show x-axis values in whole-number increments.  By default, the chart's interval is 0.1.  How do I configure this?  I've tried adding an Axis to my LineSeries as such:<br />\n<pre><code>var series = new LineSeries\n{\n    Title = state.Meta.Title,\n\n    IndependentValuePath = &quot;X&quot;,\n    DependentValuePath = &quot;Y&quot;,\n\n    DataPointStyle = x.Skipped ? state.Meta.SkippedPointStyle : state.Meta.PointStyle,\n    PolylineStyle = x.Skipped ? state.Meta.SkippedLineStyle : state.Meta.LineStyle,\n\n    IndependentAxis = new LinearAxis\n    {\n        Interval = 1,\n        Orientation = AxisOrientation.X\n    },\n\n    ItemsSource = x.Data\n};</code></pre>\n\nbut this results is my chart having more than two ActualAxis.  I end up with one Y and many Xs.  Unfortunately, ActualAxis is not observable so I cannot configure the axis Interval or MinorTickStyle when the graph generates them.  Is there any way to get in the middle of ActualAxis creation and change properties on that axis?  I can't find any kind of event to hook into that occurs when this happens.<br />\n<br />\nAny help here would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks<br />\n",
