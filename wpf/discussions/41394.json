Blend creates the style but didn´t associated it with any &quot;TargetType&quot; - this is the XAML created by Blend for my Style :<br>\r\n&lt;Style x:Key=&quot;DataGridRowStyle&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing around I find that I have to change this line to:<br>\r\n&lt;Style x:Key=&quot;DataGridRowStyle&quot; <span style=\"background-color:#ffffcc\">TargetType=&quot;tkt:DataGridRow&quot;</span>/&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis line works with other Styles (i.e. ColumnHeaderStyles and changing TargetType to DataGridColumnHeader) but in this case, when I try to change my new created DataGridRow Style I´m getting this NullReferenceException ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone can help me ? Doing my styling manually into VS2008 give me the desired DataGrid but I think that doing this kind of work in Blend is much more productive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTIA<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalcir<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
