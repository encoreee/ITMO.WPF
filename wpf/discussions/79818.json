The thing is though, I need to be able to switch out exactly what the RowDetails will be based on that. For example, if the click Add, I want to show RowDetails below Row of type AddRowDetailControl, and if they choose Edit, I would want to show a different control under the same row instead. Is this possible?</p>",
