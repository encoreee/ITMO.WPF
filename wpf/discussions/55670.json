But when I sort the grid by clicking on any column header and then try to click on any button (moveUp or Down), it doesn't work. I debug the code and I can see that actual items in collection which I have binded is changed, I mean moving does happen in collection (ObservableCollection) but UI doesn't refresh.</p>\r\n<p>So, I am guessing something happens after sorting of rows in grid internally but I can't exactly what is going wrong.</p>\r\n<p>If anybody can help me in this than it would be much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance......</p>",

BindingExpression:Path=Description; DataItem='Object' (HashCode=8761822); target element is 'TextBlock' (Name=''); target property is 'Text' (type 'String')</p>\r\n<p>I know that this error occurs because of it trys to bind default empty row in my grid. Is there any way to get rid of this error because I want that empty row to allow the user to enter new row. I looked for solution in this forum but i couldn't find any.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again..</p>",

It would be even better if the DataGrid didn't try to data bind the cells in the empty row until it is instantiated, though.</p>",
