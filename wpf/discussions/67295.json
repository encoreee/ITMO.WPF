    "Html": "<p>You should be able to fairly easily build the DataGrid.Columns collection at runtime.&nbsp; The first thing you should try is binding DataGrid's ItemsSource to your array to see if the autogeneration of columns feature can interpret it and automatically create the columns for you.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, I would recommend parsing the array and building a collection of items which the autogeneration feature can interpret (such as a collection of objects of your own custom type which has properties for each field specified in the array).&nbsp; You can customize which columns get displayed by hooking into the autogeneration events and cancelling or modifying each column as it's created.</p>",
