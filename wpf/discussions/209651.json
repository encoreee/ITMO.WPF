There must be some way to catch what has been written into the row of the DataGrid?</p>\r\n<p>I also tried to move the event to the code behind, but it's the same. So I guess I'm doing something wrong due to my noob-ity ;-)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Tomas Sandkvist</p>\r\n<p>Sweden</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
