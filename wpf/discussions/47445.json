    "Html": "I have a DataGrid bound to an ObservableCollection. The Grid is sorted on Column 0 (which is a numeric column). The sort works fine on initalization, but when an item in the ObservableCollection changes (not as a result of a UI change, but a background change), the sort becomes stale and inaccurate. I have hooked up my ObservableCollection to fire the CollectionChanged event with Reset when this occurs but nothing is reflected in the UI. calling Refresh on the Items also has no effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this a known bug?<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nEli\r\n",
