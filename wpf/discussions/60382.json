I've created a small app which runs fine on XP/Vista/Win7 and Win2k8, but always fails on these 2 virtual boxes. <br><br>Has anyone seen this before and/or got any ideas how I could figure out how to find out what settings/config are different on these boxes. Please bear in mind that I have had the datagrid app running on these servers before. <br><br>Cheers, Mike...</p>\r\n<p>BTW, The app if you want to see it is in a zip file here: <a href=\"http://www.mac-ware.co.uk/download/WPFDatagridTestApp.zip\">http://www.mac-ware.co.uk/download/WPFDatagridTestApp.zip</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
