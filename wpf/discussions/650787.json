If I modify the cell content to a string already existing in other rows, the cell become in error mode and when it lose focus, the cell returns to the original value.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen i select the cell with tab and the arrow keys and then I directly start to type the new content, the error occurs. The cell still become un error state if I enter an existing value, but when the cell lose focus, the value isn't reverted. CancelEdit() is called, everything seems to work, but in the end, the property is set to the new erronous value. \r<br />\n<br />\nI've joined an <a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5A4717E2C95CF48!1321&amp;authkey=!AFfTtlRwNsfyA2I&amp;ithint=file%2czip\" rel=\"nofollow\">example project</a>.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nMichael<br />\n",
