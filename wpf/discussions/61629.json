When I click on the header column to sort, it takes a while (about 5 - 10 seconds or so) to finish the sorting. During that time, the user does not know what's going on. It would be nice to put some kind of wait message ane let the user know that the grid is sorting.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>Gaurav Mantri</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
