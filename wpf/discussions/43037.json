When now the key get's pressed i check if the next item in the list is a DataItem and<br>\r\nthen assign it to the SelectedItem Property of the Datagrid. So far so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut now the problem: the Cell focus doesn't shift like it should do, when i press the down key 2 or 3 times the focus (dotted line around a control) starts again at the top, the right row is still Selected!!</p>\r\n<p>If've already tried to set the FocusedElement with Keyboard.Focus, directly with .Focus onto the Cell and the Row and I just don't know what I should do now.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Anyone has a suggestion were and how I could get that thing to work? (I suspect the DataGridCell to be the Problem, because I work with FullRowSelect)</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>regards<br>\r\nThomas</p>\r\n",
