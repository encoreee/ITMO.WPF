The Datagrid itemsource is bound to collection of IEnumerable.<br>\r\nI try to use <br>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#2b91af\">ICollectionView</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\"> view = </span><span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#2b91af\">CollectionViewSource</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">.GetDefaultView(dgOrderLine.Items);<br>\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#2b91af\">IEditableCollectionView</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\"> iecv = (</span><span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#2b91af\">IEditableCollectionView</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">)view;<br>\r\niecv.EditItem(row);\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>but I dont get the object to edit. For instance (iecv.FirstName = &quot;Sara&quot;, iecv.Amount = iecv.Price * iecvNumber) or somthing like that. The result must be visible in grid, and trigg the propertychange in underlying datasource.</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>Kindly help<br>\r\n</p>\r\n",
