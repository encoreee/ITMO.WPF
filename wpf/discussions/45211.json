    "Html": "Hi, I'm trying to preserve and restore the main window, deriving from RibbonWindow, using the Window.Loaded event and an OnClosing override.  I keep getting a consistent drift of Top-56, Left-8, and ActualWidth+8.  In other words, window keeps drifting up and to the left, while the width keeps getting wider.  This happens regardless of whether I use a Settings class or just hard-coded numbers in the Loaded event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this is a known issue or is there some known delta I'm supposed to apply?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\n\\Steven<br>\r\n",
