I'm using WPF, and I have just downloaded the new version of DataGrid for WPF, but I think (in my opinion) is more difficult to use that the DataGridView in Windows Forms. I'm trying to merge cells in the DataGrid but I don't know and I haven't found any information about this problem. I'm trying to use a DataTable, then I'm using: dataGrid.DataContext=datatable. So I want to merge cells in a datatable but I don't know if it's possible. Can somebody help me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nLenchu</p>\r\n",
