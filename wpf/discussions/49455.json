Essentially I want to make sure that an item is selected from each combobox in my datagrid and while I could do this procedurally upon submission of the page, I would prefer to setup a validationrule similar to those for a DataGridTextColumn column. Given that the coder controls what can possibly be selected, I can understand why this feature would not be available for this type of control - but is there a recommended (declarative hopefully...) workaround?<div><br></div><div>Thank You</div>",
