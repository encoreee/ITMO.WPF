CanExecute always returns true for my test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also have a toolbar button in the same window that I associate to the command via it's command property.&nbsp; When I click the toolbar button, my command execute logic grabs the selected cell from the datagrid and executes successfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when I select a cell in the data grid and use the keyboard gesture I assigned the command &quot;CTRL+G&quot;, the keyboard gesture never kicks off the command execute logic.&nbsp; Do I need to add anything to the datagrid to make this work?&nbsp; My understanding is that this would have bubbled up to the handler in my main window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny Ideas?&nbsp; Thanks,<br>\r\nJon<br>\r\n",
