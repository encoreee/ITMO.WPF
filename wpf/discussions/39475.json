If we need it during runtime, then is there a runtime/redistributable version (compact) of .NET 3.5 SP1? Just at the users end (not developers end) it will be impractical to install .NET 3.5 SP1 full package as a) first of all, normal users during runtime don't need entire package b) full package size is so huge in size c) most importantly it takes so long (45 minutes or so) to install SP1 full package and installation is unstable at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso in the development environment with .NET 3.5 SP1 &amp; VS2008 SP1, compiler shows only the target of 3.5 and no target for 3.5 SP1. And if you run such compiled application in an environment that has .NET 3.5, application crashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively is there anyway to statically bind all wpftoolkit symbols during compile time into the main application so application doesn't have to rely on dll/SP1 during runtime. Basically though development process using wpftoolkit is smooth, I haven't found a way where deployment/runtime environment for normal users could be smooth. Please opine/help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nGomes\r\n",
