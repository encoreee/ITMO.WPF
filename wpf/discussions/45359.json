    "Html": "Hi Roubachof,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears you have uncovered a bug in our RibbonComboBox.  The RibbonComboBox does not currently have logic built to display the LabelTitle and Small/LargeImageSource from the RibbonCommand which is assigned to it.  You could try to retemplate RibbonComboBox in your app to display a label and icon, or it might be easier to just use a RibbonDropDownButton until we fix this in V1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nSamantha\r\n",
