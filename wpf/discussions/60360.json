The objects do implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface. I have noticed that if I have the grid sorted, and if I update the value of a field , which happens to be sorted on, the value is updated correctly on the grid, but the sorting does not update based on the new value.</p>\r\n<p>I believe this is because the grid does not update the sort on PropertyChanged event of its items? I can make it update the sort by firing a CollectionChanged event or Doing a refresh on the view from the collection. But these don't seem to be very efficient. Shouldn't the grid, on propertychanged, check if the change is on a sorted column and if so update the sorting automatically? Am I doing something wrong, or should I request this as feature?</p>\r\n<p>thanks and regards</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Bijesh</p>",
