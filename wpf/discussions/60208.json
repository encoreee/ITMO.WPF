If you can do a datatrigger just as easily as a converter, is one faster/more efficient than the other? I am thinking that having datatriggers in xaml might be faster because they get compiled to baml. On the other hand, datatriggers are harder to read.</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone know for sure?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
