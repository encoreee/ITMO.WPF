The bug is different if I change the binding Mode of Index column Binding (see AssociatedDataGrid.SynchronizeVerticalDataGrid method)<br /><br />If you change to OneWay Mode, Datagrids work differently ... With TwoWay, grid A change index property of column C, Column C of the Grid B change, and Column A, and B change of Grid B change, with Binding,&nbsp; column A, B and C of Grid A change too ... It is a little bit complex to manage this algorithm ....<br /><br />This code is a prototype, just a prove of concept<br />For real application, I think it would be better to don't use Binding to synchonize index of columns, for Width property, I think is OK, but for index property, kinematics of change's properties is difficult to control with Binding ... It would better to use the \"old school\" algorithm ... (override metaproperty of Index column property, and use DependencyChangedProperty event to synchonize himself grid A and Grid B OR use Attached property to intercept cyclique change of Index property Values)<br /><br />I hope it can help you to adapt this code for your needed<br /><br />Best regards</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
