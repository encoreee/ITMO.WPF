Those cells on the diagonal are &quot;neutral&quot;, those cells above diagonal are &quot;positive&quot;, below diagonal are &quot;negative&quot;. I would like to hightlight positive and negative cells in some way: font color, weght, background, anyhow. This table allows to show some dynamic at two time points so that diagonal cells show no changes, but other cells do show changes between these two time points</p>",
