(If you could send a screenshot, that might help.)  If it's just the background, this is a known issue and it's super easy to fix.  Just set RibbonWindow.Background=&quot;White.&quot;  If it's something more complicated than that, please send a screenshot and maybe a simple repro so that we can investigate this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\nSam\r\n",
