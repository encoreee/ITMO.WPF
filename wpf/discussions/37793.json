In ListView for example I usually use the GroupDescriptions and GroupStyle properties.Is there any corresponding properties in the DataGrid (especially for GroupDescriptions )? Does the GroupStyleSelector &amp; GroupStyle properties has any relevance for that purpose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance<br>\r\n",
