He embeds a few fields on a tabControl page to illustrate the principles. There are a couple things I don't understand:</p>\r\n<p>1) What are the triggers that execute SaveCommand? In general the Microsoft documentation says a Command triggers each time the control is clicked. Of-course there is no click here. I can see the SaveCommand executes each time a new Tab page is created (i.e.\r\n a new customer tab is created). It also triggers each time I switch from one tab to another. But it is not triggered when I minimize the window.</p>\r\n<p>2) Follow-up to above question: when CanSave becomes true and I actually Click on the button, SaveCommand is not triggerred! Of-course the this.Save() is executed, as expected, but since Microsoft says a click triggers the command I am confused. Perhaps\r\n the explanation is as simple as the click triggers the declared method, this.Save(), not the ICommand itself?</p>\r\n<p>3) Each keystroke in any of the input fields on the tab cause this.CanSave() to execute. I am a newcomer to Commands but how does this single reference to CanSave() within the SaveCommand code trigger CanSave() on every keystroke?</p>\r\n<p>******************************************************************************************</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>&lt;Button Command=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;{Binding Path=SaveCommand}&quot;</span> Content=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;_Save&quot;</span> /&gt;\r\n\r\n <span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> ICommand SaveCommand\r\n        {\r\n            <span style=\"color:blue\">get</span>\r\n            {\r\n                <span style=\"color:blue\">if</span> (_saveCommand == <span style=\"color:blue\">null</span>)\r\n                {\r\n                     _saveCommand = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> RelayCommand(\r\n                          param =&gt; <span style=\"color:blue\">this</span>.Save(),\r\n                          param =&gt; <span style=\"color:blue\">this</span>.CanSave\r\n                      );\r\n                }\r\n                <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> _saveCommand;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>*****************************************************************************************</p>\r\n",
