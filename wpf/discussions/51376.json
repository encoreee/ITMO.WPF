If I use the spacebar as the selector-key, the proplem not occures, because the selection stays on the same row. By using the enter-key, the selection changes to the next row and if I read the selectetItem-property of the DataGrid it returns the new selected row, which is the wrong one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have also testet the &quot;keyDown&quot;-event, but that way does not work, because the enter-Key does not fire a &quot;keyDown&quot;-event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
