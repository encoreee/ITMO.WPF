Instead it is appearing always at the end (as if it were added versus inserted). I checked and it appears to be in the correct location within the list after being inserted.\r<br />\n<br />\nSide note: I could have added items of type KeyValuePair&lt;double, double&gt; but the bars directly overlap (versus being offset) if added/inserted items fall on the same x-axis value.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any help/pointers you can lend in this.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlan<br />\n",
