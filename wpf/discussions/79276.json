After selecting rows I am right clicking to show up the context menu.Context menu has command and command parameter binding. SelectedItems of datagrid is passed as command parameter.(CommandParameter=&quot;{Binding Path=SelectedItems,Converter={StaticResource itemsSelectedToRulesetListItemConverter} , RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor,AncestorType={x:Type my:DataGrid}}}&quot;)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>*Command parameter convertion i.e. selected I items to my source object convertion (IConvert) is done only once. If I repeat the selections and contextmenu selection but no new convertions occured. Always the first selected items are provided to command handler.</p>\r\n<p>*I tried to get selectedItems of datagrid in the command handler but always it has o items in it. I think openning the context menu and making the selection resets selecteditems</p>\r\n<p>how can I achieve this binding?</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>",
