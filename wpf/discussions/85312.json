I tried to bind the textual properties (&nbsp;LabelTitle, TooltipTitle, TooltipDescription.) but this can not be done.<br>So I tried to access these properties in code-behind, but it seems that only the change of &quot;LabelTitle&quot; property works ok. Changing the other 2 properties (TooltipTitle and TooltipDescription) has no effect on the Ribbon control.<br><br>Am I missing some refresh methods that should be performed after changing these properties ??<br><br>Yoav.</p>",
