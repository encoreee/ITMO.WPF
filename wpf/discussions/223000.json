I noticed there is another class, AccordionItemWrapperAutomationPeer, and am suspicious that this is what is presented to Automation by the Accordion control.</p>\r\n<p>Can anyone confirm that this is the case and the Accordion's UI Automation is a bit buggy, or can they shed some light on why I can't access the ExpandCollapse pattern which looks like it should be available on the Items?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Graeme</p>",
