We have found that it doesn't read column headers of the datagrid even we click on the column header. Is there any property set, in order to make it readable for Narrator? We have already set column name property; and the Narrator does read the cell contents properly.</p>\r\n<p>Note: In certain cases we just assign the itemsource to the datagrid and then its columns are generated automatically. Is there any way to make it readable for Narrator in such cases?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Charith</p>",
