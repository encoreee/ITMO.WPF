I want to show each y value in different color. I found the sample in <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2009/02/04/columns-of-a-different-color-customizing-the-appearance-of-silverlight-charts-with-re-templating-and-mvvm.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/archive/2009/02/04/columns-of-a-different-color-customizing-the-appearance-of-silverlight-charts-with-re-templating-and-mvvm.aspx</a>. It shows different color for each x axis (x1, x2 and x3).</p>\r\n<p>But In my case, I want to show different color for each y value for all the x axis. For example (y1, y4,y7 will be in same color and y2,y5,y8 will be&nbsp;another color and etc...) also I want to show all three kind of y axis in legend.</p>\r\n<p>Could you please help me on this.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in Advance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
