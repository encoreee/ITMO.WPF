I want to commit <strong>only</strong> when the Enter-key is pressed. How would I go about this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance,<br>\r\nFrances<br>\r\n",

It would be a nice feature for the DataGrid if the developer could specify on which actions changes to the data should be committed (hint, hint ;-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nFrances<br>\r\n",
