I have the command binding on the tool panel. When the focus is on the tool panel, the Ribbon buttons have the correct status(enabled), but after clicking on the Ribbon button, the focus is shifted to the Ribbon immediately, effectively disable the button before the click event is handled. After all, the command is not usable. Is there anything I can do to work around this focus shifting? Thanks!</span>\r\n",
