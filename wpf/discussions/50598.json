And later maybe I'll use selectedItems <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<em>DataItemType selectedItem = dgPointCloud.SelectedItem as DataItemType;</em><br>\r\n<em>if (selectedItem != null)</em><br>\r\n<em>{</em><br>\r\n<em>DataGridRow row = (DataGridRow)dgPointCloud.ItemContainerGenerator.ContainerFromItem(selectedItem);<br></em>\r\n<em>if (null != row && !row.IsEditing)</em><br>\r\n<em>...</em><br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo if select one row, then select another row just by click row header, both the two rows will be selected, even more, they'll do drag and drop immediately. After I read other sample code and use the following replace, it's no problem.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDataGridRow row = FindVisualParent&lt;DataGridRow&gt;(e.OriginalSource as FrameworkElement);<br>\r\nif ((row != null) && !row.IsEditing && row.IsSelected)<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBut I'm still not clear how to do Multi-Row Drag&Drop now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nDan<br> <br>\r\n<hr id=stopSpelling>\r\nFrom: [email removed]<br>To: [email removed]<br>Date: Tue, 24 Mar 2009 13:05:16 -0700<br>Subject: Re: Select rows by RowHeader [wpf:50598]<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: BenCarter<br>\r\n<div id=\"EC_ThreadNotificationPostBody\">When SelectionUnit is FullRow or CellOrRowHeader, you should be able to select rows when clicking on the headers.
