My converter does data validation from a database, so I do not want to have to call into the database twice (once for a validation pass and once for a conversion).</p>\r\n<p>I created:<br>public class FixNameDataTypeConverter : <span style=\"background:yellow\">ValidationRule,</span> IMultiValueConverter</p>\r\n<p>I have gotten my multivalueconverter to work, so I know that it is solid. I have gotten the validation rule to fire. However, I suspect that my xaml is wrong because the textbox never turns red. Has anyone ever tried this? If so, what would the xaml look like?</p>\r\n<p>THANKS SO MUCH!!!</p>",
