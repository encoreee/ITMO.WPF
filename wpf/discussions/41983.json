    "Html": "Hi jgdove,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ideally setting CanUserSort to false on column was supposed to collapse the sort arrow. But since this functionality is implemented in code through DataGridHeaderBorder for perf reasons (just like ButtonChrome) rather than XAML, it seems that this case has been missed out resulting in &quot;CanUserSort=false&quot; being ineffective in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that the only way of solving your problem is to set Background on DataGridColumnHeader to something of your interest, in which case you will loose all the default functionality like mouse hover etc. including Sort arrows OR retemplate the DataGridColumnHeader from the scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, I assume that this problem is relevant only to XP, since in Vista the arrow is at the top (instead of right).\r\n",
