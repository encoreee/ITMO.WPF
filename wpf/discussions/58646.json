I want to have a combobox column which allows a user to select an item in the ObservableCollection or type a new one. So far the closest I've come is to use a TemplateColumn containing a ComboBox in the CellEditingTemplate, then use the LostKeyboardFocus to check the ObjectDataProvider's List to see if it contains the text entered. If not, add it.</p>\r\n<p>I can add the text so it's visible and selectable if I go to re-edit the combobox or any other row's combobox, but the value I entered isn't selected the first time I commit and I'm not sure why.</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>",
