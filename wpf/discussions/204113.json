I have a solution using checkboxes &quot;working&quot;, but you have to click twice, once to select a row and then one more click on the checkbox, this is terrible. What would be really cool, would be to just be able to select rows using control/shift in a windows-style to select rows and then databind the selected rows.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyone got a solution for either databinding selecting rows or a way to remove the extra click when using checkboxes?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>/Michael</p>",
