This collection implements IEditableObject for use with committing values back to the database.</p>\r\n<p>The issue I am running into is that sometimes these events are not firing and as a result I am not able to persist my data.</p>\r\n<p>On the contrary if I use the BeginningEdit event of the DataGrid, it always fires.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So somehow the datagrid is not allowing edit.</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone encountered this issue before?</p>\r\n<p>What can I check to make sure why the events are not being raised etc?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
