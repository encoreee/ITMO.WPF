I only need to view a group of element of my database, without using any kind of ROWHEADER.... I managed to view the element of my list with the correct binding in column header, but when the number of elements increases, scrolling the list, for some items appear a strange vertical gray rectangle. I put mouse over this element and it appears an orange line...Â totally similar to a ROWHEADER (element having this row header are not the same scrolling up&amp;down the list).... I can't resize or move the row, only a little orange line passing the mouse over.... the problem is that item with this &quot;Ghost Header&quot; is not allined with the other...<br>\r\nAnyone have an idea about solving this problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
