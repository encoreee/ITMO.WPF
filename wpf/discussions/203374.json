(e.g. Resize, Delete, etc.)</p>\r\n<p>The click event of the context menu does not seem to give me a ref. to the cell that was right clicked on.</p>\r\n<p>I've found many articles talking about how to traverse the visual tree and other very complex methods of doing this.</p>\r\n<p>It seems like it should be simple (and I'm a beginner). Does anyone know if there's an easy way to get hold of the contents of the cell when the Click even it fired from the ContextMenu?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Warrick</p>",
