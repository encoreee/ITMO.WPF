Because of performance reasons, it is not possible to fetch all data from the database.<br>\r\nI think of something like at first only to get a total items count (to scale the scrollbar) and then to get only that data from the database that comes into view.<br>\r\nDatagrid has UI virtualization as far as I know, but I'd rather need a feature like data virtualization. Is there a way to get this done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance for any help.<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi heroicinventor,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the DataGrid (and none of the other WPF controls) support data virtualization out-of-the-box at the moment.  However, it is possible to roll your own using a strategy like you suggested if you're willing to write some code.  Some third-party providers also have data virtualization solutions.  I would recommend that you search online to find a solution which works for you, whether it be a guide to writing your own data virtualization (there are lots of blog posts about this) or a pre-built solution which you can purchase.  The WPF team does have data virtualization on our roadmap for a future release, but unfortunately it will not be available in our next release (.NET 4.0).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\nSamantha\r\n",
