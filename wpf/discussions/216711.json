But some advanced charts had not make it into WPF unfortunately.</p>\r\n<p>Using the Toolkit is a bit difficult, as the documentation is not really great (but the parts in WPF4.0 are not good either). And its not building on my VS2010 machine as the sources are not adjusted f&uuml;r .Net 4.0 up to now.</p>\r\n<p>Would be sad if they just stopped going further with that (no developer was active since more than 60 days...).</p>",
