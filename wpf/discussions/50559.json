I suspect this one is known, but I'll pass it along anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>Behavior:</strong> VS 2008 compiler throws following error when an unnamed calendar is loaded:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<em>Cannot find type 'Microsoft.Windows.Controls.Calendar'. The assembly used when compiling might be different than that used when loading and the type is missing.Â  Error at object 'System.Windows.Controls.Grid' in markup file 'MyUserControl.xaml' Line 15 Position 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</em><strong>Steps to reproduce: </strong>Add a calendar to a UserControl from the VS 2008 toolbox. Delete the 'name' attribute. Hit F5. Error will occur. Reinstate 'name' attribute. Control will load.\r\n",
