The grouping as I copied and modified from this example is working as I expected.&nbsp; If I remove this binding I don't get a heading for the group, if I change it to the property I am grouping by it does not work. Is this some sort of majic cookie that just has to be there?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Tom</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
