When I grab it and try to drop it onto the form, I get the black circle with a line through it telling me it cannot be added there. I can it between tabes in the tool bar but that is it. the same thing happens for all the controls in the tool kit. Any thoughts on what I may have done wrong?</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Glupii,</p>\r\n<p>Do the controls work if you manually add them directly in the XAML instead of dragging them onto the design surface?&nbsp; If so, then I suspect there just is some quirk in the designer.&nbsp; Try restarting VS, and if that doesn't help, sometimes the Toolbox just needs to be reset after you install the Toolkit.&nbsp; If you right-click on the Toolbox, there should be a reset option in the context menu.&nbsp; Let me know if that works for you.&nbsp; Also, just to confirm, you are using VS 2008?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>Samantha</p>",

So I am working now. For the record I could not drag and drop any of hte controls from the toolbox to any part of the XAML or Window until I complete the reset. Thanks for the response.</p>",
