The point is: when I left click on top of a row the context menu appears (with a menu item) and I click on an option that allows me to edit all the data on a new Window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been able to do everything except obtaining the clicked row in order to know wich data to ind to the form..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there a way to obtain it? ... The &quot;e&quot; parameter of the &quot;menuitem&quot; clicked doesn't provide access to the selected row?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance<br>\r\n",
