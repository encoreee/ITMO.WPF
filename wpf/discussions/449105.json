    "Html": "I have a Chart with a Column Series. The data ranges from -100 to -60 (for example), but I want the vertical LinearAxis to have the range from 0 to -100 (or slightly more). I can set the Maximum and Minimum properties of the LinearAxis manually, but then then the Chart will 'Clip' if the data range exceeds the manually set limit.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas? Ideally I want to set the LinearAxis.Minimum value to &quot;*&quot; (or something like that) to indicate that it should stretch to the full range of the data, while LinearAxis.Maximum is set to 0.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance for any help on this matter.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Oh dear - I just tried playing around some more and seem to have solved the problem. I just needed to not set a value for the LinearAxis.Minimum - therefore it was autoscaling to the data. I still might run into a problem if I have data that ranges from -100 to +100 (positive and negative data) since I have set the LinearAxis.Maximum to 0 (to force showing 0 on the axis if the data is only negative).<br />\n",
