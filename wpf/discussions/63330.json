Currently its only when I click a button that I dynamically create a chart object and add to the visual hierarchy.</p>\r\n<p>I can reproduce with a stand alone app but dont see a place to upload it here.</p>\r\n<p>I am using VS2008 with all the latest service packs for silverlight/wpf. I reference the datavisualization file from the GAC as it was installed by the msi. Visual studio has its path as c:\\Program Files (x86)\\WPF Toolkit\\v3.5.40619.1\\System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit.dll</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Adam</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Adam,</p>\r\n<p>I've never heard of this before... One quick idea: do you maybe not have .NET 3.5 *SP1* installed on that machine? The WPF Toolkit is compiled against SP1, so maybe the design stuff is mis-matching for you and causing this problem?</p>\r\n<p>If you're still stuck, contact me via the &quot;This Blog&quot;/Email link on my blog (<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/\">http://blogs.msdn.com/delay/</a>) and give me your email address. I can reply and then you can send me the standalone app. Or just upload it to somewhere like Windows Live SkyDrive and post the URL here or send it to me via the contact link.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>",
