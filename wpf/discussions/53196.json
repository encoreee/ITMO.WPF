It doesn't seem to take effect until after I changed the SelectedDate of the control. I've tried doing it programmatically but that doesn't work. I've also tried calling ApplyTemplate and OnApplyTemplate on the control to no avail either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do I make sure the template is applied when the control is displayed initially and before a selection is actually made?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nSøren<br>\r\n",
