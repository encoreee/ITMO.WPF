    "Html": "Hi keithwilliams324,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure if I understand what you're asking for exactly, but maybe are you looking for RowDetails?  You can set the RowDetailsTemplate to include additional information for a row in whatever format you choose (whether it's another row, just a TextBlock, or a whole DataGrid).  You can use RowDetailsTemplate like so:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;dg:DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate&gt;<br>\r\n     &lt;DataTemplate&gt;<br>\r\n          ... this is where you put your second row ...                    <br>\r\n     &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;        <br>\r\n&lt;/dg:DataGrid.RowDetailsTemplate&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes that help at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nSamantha\r\n",
