Setting the FocusedElement attached property solved this one for me.</p>\r\n<p>Next by default, the entire text should be selected - this works for a TextColumn, but not for a TemplateColumn. I tried setting a style with a GotFocus event setter - this works for normal textboxes but didnt work for one that is embedded within an edit template.</p>\r\n<p>Tried using the various BeginEdit PrepareCellForEdit events : In these events the edit cell data template has not been expanded - the passed in UI Element is ContentPresenter with null Content. So can't get a hold of the textbox to do a textBox.SelectAll(). What is the right point to hook-in ; at which the data template has been expanded.</p>\r\n<p>The code to repro this can be seen at - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2640327</p>",
