I want to bind the DataContext of the StackPanel to the item that is &quot;currently selected&quot; in my grid (and then bind the individual controls to properties of that object). Would I rather use SelectedItem or CurrentItem in that case?</p>\r\n<p>Also, can you please explain the magic of&nbsp;IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Karlox<span style=\"font-family:Consolas;color:#ff0000;font-size:x-small\"><span style=\"font-family:Consolas;color:#ff0000;font-size:x-small\"></span></span></p>",
