    "Html": "Hi Brent,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in time VSM is available through the WPFToolKit.  This release of the VSM offers alot of great features and also closes the compatibility gap between Silverlight and WPF, because Silverlight doesn't have triggers.  However, I do not recommend shipping VSM in production code at this point.  I personally suggest you wait and adopt VSM from the .NET 4.0 release.  Our goal for VSM in the .NET 4.0 is to migrate the state-change logic from the behavior classes into the controls themselves, similar to that in Silverlight today.  Additionally, you may want to take note of an issue that's come up with the current version of VSM.  You can read about it here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=VSM Memory Leak\">http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=VSM%20Memory%20Leak</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope that helps you with your project Brent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nSaied Khanahmadi\r\n",
