But&nbsp;I found out, that when the user clicks the small area directly above the scrollbar, which looks like a part of the header not the header contextmenu is shown. The grid shows the contextmenu of the body.</p>\r\n<p>We have the rquirement that there should be shown the header contextmenu and I could not figure ouot how to find out if it is the area above the scrollbar and show the right contextmenu. Does anybody have an idea?</p>",
