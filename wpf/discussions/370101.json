Y1 axis shows temperature and Y2 axis shows pressure against Time on X axis.</p>\r\n<p>Both axes may show different scales (range min - max) like temperature from 0 to 100 Degree kelvin &amp; pressure from 300 to 900 kPa and accordingly the series will be plotted.</p>\r\n<p>I am looking for open source control or freeware which can provide this feature.</p>\r\n<p>I am trying to use WPF for plotting graphs and studying WPF Tookit for that.</p>\r\n<p>Please look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/interacting-axes.html\">\r\nFLOT example of multiple axes</a>. I want this feature in WPF.</p>\r\n<p>But I am not able to find feature of <strong>independent</strong> multiple axes in these controls.</p>\r\n<p>Please help otherwise I have to drop the idea of using WPF.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
