The DateTime values in the grid will be in UTC format (they are coming from the server).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, when the dates get rendered, they will not get rendered in BST time and are therefore one hour out. Can anyone suggest an automatic way of specifying that the Grid needs to perform a ToLocalTime on the dates it handles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, can anyone provide a solution to allow me to call a converter just for the columns that are of format DateTime? I do not know the format of the columns before it is genererated, so cannot attach a data template to a particular column in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance for anyone who can help,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil<br>\r\n",
