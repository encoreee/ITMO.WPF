But in this case, we loose automatic updates.</p>\r\n<p>Is it possible to associate an URL protocol with a clickonce application, without loosing the auto-update? I already try with a launcher (simple .exe that launch the appref-ms file), but I prefere a cleaner solution.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",

It sounds like you are able to write to the register, but not associate the protocol to the ClickOnce app.<br />\n<br />\nWere you able to come up with a solution?  Are there other problems with ClickOnce I should be aware of when using with a URL Protocol?<br />\n<br />\nMatt<br />\n",
