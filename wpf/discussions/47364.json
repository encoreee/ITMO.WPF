I have code that sets each DataGridRow's Header to a particular string such that every single header row in the DataGrid displays the name of a product (I do it trough the LOADING ROW EVENT). For whatever reason I am having problems scrolling. It's hard to explain really but basically what is happening is that as I am scrolling vertically down using the &quot;down&quot; arrow button of the scrollbar, once I start getting close to the &quot;end&quot; of the DataGrid the thumb position starts moving randomly up and down and does not follow the scroll instruction I am giving it by clicking on the &quot;down&quot; arrow scroll button. <br>\r\nAny IDEA to solve the problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that the problem is that DATAGRID not load all the rows, but only those are visible.... so when I scroll Up&amp;Down something strange happens.... Is there a way to tell the datagrid to load ALL the ROWS at the beginning of the initialization?....\r\n",
