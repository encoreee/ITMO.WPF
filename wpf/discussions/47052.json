Do I have to compare every record in the list to look for changes??<br>\r\nI don't want to update all the records in the list when only a few records are changed.<br>\r\nI could'n find anything like 'RowState' or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance,<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi Vinsibal,<br>\r\nThanks for your reply. I did read the article (and many others) but it didn't help. <br>\r\nWhat I want is for the user to 'play'around in the grid (add/delete and insert).<br>\r\nI do validate the cells during these updates, but to commit the changes to the database the user explictly needs to click on a 'save' button.<br>\r\nAt that point I only want the 'changed' records to commit to the database. But how can I detect wich records are changed when I don't have a RowState or RecordState?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n",
