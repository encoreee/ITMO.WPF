I have Windows 7 64bit, VS2010.</p>\r\n<p>I am building a WFP project and I referencec all DLL files found under WPF Toolkit folder, when I launch the application in debug mode I got exception message: &quot;<span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Could not load file or assembly 'WPFToolkit, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified</span>&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>After some search I saw some people talked about add these DLL to GAC, but I don't want this. Is there a way I can load WPF toolkit <span style=\"color:#ff0000\">WITHOUT</span> GAC? Because I need to distribute the desktop application to uses without WPF Toolkit installed, I would like to reference to local DLL files instead.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Hardy</p>",
