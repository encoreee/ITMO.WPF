    "Html": "I'm using RowDetails in a DataGrid and I've got some troubles with vertical scrolling. By default when all my RowDetails are collapsed the DataGrid scrolls vertically by one row at a time. This is fine but when I expand the RowDetail on the top row, subsequent scrolling will skip whole RowDetail section right to the next row. Is there a way to make scrolling smoother so I can scroll through the RowDetail section, when expanded, rather then just skip to the next row?\r\n",
