Through trial and error I have an ugly grid that doesn't scroll and whose header columns are misaligned with the columns in the rows. More importantly, is there a better way (than trial and error) to customize the controltemplate? For example, could I somehow discover the default control template and just tweak it for my needs? I feel like I'm wasting too much time even for a novice.\r\n",
