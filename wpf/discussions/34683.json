If the item is a type of&nbsp;entity object, eg Customer,&nbsp;and you supply a DataTemplate for&nbsp;the Customer type, the&nbsp;ContentPresenter will use the DataTemplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the ComboBox itself supports DataTemplates, I think the&nbsp;DataGridComboBoxColumn should as well.<br>\r\n",
