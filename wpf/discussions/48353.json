I have requirement  to display the new row to the user allowing him to add new data row. I am able to do this by creating the Control template for DataGridRow and load it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally the new row will be displayed after all the rows. My problem is I want to display this new row always in the end of grid's scrollable area even if i have more rows and vertical scroll bar is available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there any way to achive this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance for any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrasad\r\n",
