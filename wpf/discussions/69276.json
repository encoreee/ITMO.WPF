Data from database will be loaded&nbsp;into DataGrid&nbsp; based on users' selection from ComboBox. Now what I want to do is&nbsp;set window opacity to .5 before data finder (method)&nbsp;is called (usually it takes about 15 seconds), next set window back to 1.0 when data is completely loaded.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find window freezes when data finder is called. Looks like Setting opacity to .5 works after data is loaded into DataGrid (even though I set it before method is called). Why would it work this way?&nbsp;Or should I have to use second Thread to perform data finding?&nbsp;Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Troy</p>",
