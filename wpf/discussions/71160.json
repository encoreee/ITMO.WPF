The problem with that approach is I want the user to be able to slide the dates around &amp; each time a category axis's bound data changes all the series need to redraw themselves.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone have a good idea on a solution here? I'm thinking I could either implement a custom axis that inherits RangeAxis from the source (but that leads me down versioning issues, etc.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Or I could somehow get a DateTimeAxis and CategoryAxis working together so that the user sees a category axis &amp; the data is bound as such, but the interaction happens through a datetimeaxis so dates can be changed</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Alan</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
