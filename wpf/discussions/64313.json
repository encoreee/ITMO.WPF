It works but not perfect as expected.&nbsp;I&nbsp;change Opacity of&nbsp;Main window (say .35) when waiting message window is popped up and change it back to original when whole process (usually it takes about several minutes) is done. However I find main window totally freezes and even worse it leaves a movement path of pop-up window if I move it around.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas? Thanks a lot.</p>",
