My cloning code runs fine but does not clone the datatriggers. As a consequence the cloned datatemplate do not have the proper layouting.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; I have made various try of enumerating the triggers collection of the source template to add them to the cloned template. All my try have been stopped by the same exception:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Unsupported exception unable to find child with name 'TextValue' in visual tree. However the visual tree is cloned and has the element in it.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; I cant' find any sample for properly creating datatriggers from code.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; Any help is welcome.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
