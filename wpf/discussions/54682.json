I want to add a validation rule to check that the first cell of the row is unique in the ObservableCollection, but I can't find a way of doing it. I know row level validation is possible, and if I could pass the observable collection to the validator I could check the items but ValidationRule isn't a DependencyObject so this doesn't work.</p>\r\n<p>Has anyone managed to achieve column level validation? Any suggestions?</p>\r\n",
