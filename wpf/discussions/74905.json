Foo has a boolean property &quot;CanAck&quot; and I'd like to set the RowStyle based on this bool. I already have a style defining foreground and background colours which works fine but I'd like to invert these if the value of &quot;CanAsk&quot; is false. Can anyone point me int he right direction?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers</p>\r\n<p>Rich</p>",
