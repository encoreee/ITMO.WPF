I would like to have a button that move’s a combo box’s selection down. I assumed that this was the “MoveDown” command and that the combo box  already has the binding. But my button forever remains disabled. My button looks like this:<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">&lt;StackPanel Orientation=&quot;Horizontal&quot; FocusManager.IsFocusScope=&quot;True&quot;&gt;</span>\r\n<p> <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">     &lt;Button Command=&quot;MoveDown&quot; CommandTarget=&quot;{Binding ElementName=BookcaseComboBox}&quot; Content=&quot;ç&quot; FontFamily=&quot;Wingdings&quot;/&gt;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">&lt;/StackPanel&gt; <br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms\">Am I missing something? Do I have to code this command myself?</span>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
