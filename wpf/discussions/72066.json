To make things worse, it's not possible to replace the default template for DataGridComboBoxColumn+TextBlockComboBox since the class is internal.</p>\r\n<p>I've thought about putting a negative margin somewhere (ElementStyle?) but that seems like a hack - does anyone have any proper way of solving this?</p>",
