    "Html": "As already suggested, you can solve this by manually setting up the bindings in code. I do this for a list of objects with several fields I want to display in a single row in my grid. However, there may be some issues with how the columns bindings are cleared. See my other post on manually creating and clearing bindings for example code. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have a list, you will need to use the array syntax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDataGridTextColumn newColumn = new DataGridTextColumn();<br>\r\nnewColumn.Binding = new Binding(&quot;MyPath&quot;);<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere MyPath is of the form &quot;MyOuterList[ListIndex].ProperyNameOrValue&quot;, and is a string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope this helps,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\r\n",
