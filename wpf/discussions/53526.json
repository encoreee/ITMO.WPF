The datepicker control does not display a time portion of the datetime, will this be included in the future?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, since the time portion is not handled, it seems that when you tab through the field, the property it is bound to&nbsp; now gets the datetime with the correct date but the time portion set back to &quot;12:00:00am&quot;. This is a bit of a pain.. have others seen this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nHarold<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
