    "Html": "<p>Hi dawidlazinski,</p>\r\n<p>Right now there is just one template for the Ribbon ToolTip that is generated, and it will stretch the image you assign to fit that template. However, an image is not required for the ToolTip, so you can just leave the ToolTipImageSource and ToolTipFooterImageSource properties blank if you don't really need the image in your ToolTip.  I believe you could also override the autogenerated ToolTip by setting a ToolTip locally on the control.  We'll look into making some improvements to the autogenerated ToolTip template in V1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI believe that there is a standard size for the image in the application button, so likely the image is just getting scaled down to fit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands-on-lab located <a href=\"http://windowsclient.net/downloads/folders/hands-on-labs/entry76491.aspx\">here</a> includes a sample of Ribbon and you can look at the icons in the lab to see an examples of images that work well in the Ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\nSamantha</p>\r\n",
