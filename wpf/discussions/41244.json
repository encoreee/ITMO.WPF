The keys I want to catch is the numbers 0-9 and F2, but I cannot find a location to do this.<br>\r\nAlso tried to create a subclass och the DataGridColumn to try this out, but the method OnInput is internal inside the toolkit and I don´t want to place my class inside the local toolkit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeached on the discusions and found a suggestion that the event PreparingCellForEdit should be used, however I cannot use this event since the key-event should place the column in editing mode and then the PreparingCellForEdit is raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny suggestions how to do this ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonus question: Is there any plan for including a DataGridColumnDatePicker inside the toolkit or framework 4.0 ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbest regards<br>\r\n/Tony\r\n",
