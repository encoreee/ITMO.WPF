In my situation, I need to have a column bound to the selected item of a combobox and the path a property of the selected object.</p>\r\n<p>2. I'd like to have a more than one binding for a column. I'd like a binding one-way target to source and another one-way source to target. So the effect here would be a passthrough of data from one data source object to another, through the datagrid's column's binding.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>TIA,</p>\r\n<p>Bill</p>",
