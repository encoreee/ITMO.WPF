The last problem (with GetCell()) I can probably work around by disabling virtualisation at the start of the routine that calls it then enabling it again at the end (so far it is only used for copying the data from the data grid prior to exporting or printing that data, so this should not cause any other problems), but on the others I am out of ideas. Can anybody offer any suggestions?</p>",
