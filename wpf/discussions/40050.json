    "Html": "The content of my RowDetails is pretty tall (up to 400 pixels), when I scroll it only shows whole rows and thus it makes scrolling jumpy. I know that I can use the attached property ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll=&quot;False&quot; to smooth out the scrolling, but this turns off row virtualization and I've got a LOT of rows in my grid. Is there any way to get both smooth scrolling and virtualized rows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks!<br>\r\n",
