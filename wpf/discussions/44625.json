    "Html": "I am using an Expander in my DataGrid &lt;GroupStyle.ContainerStyle&gt; to provide data grouping. After I set the grid's ItemsSource, all the groups are initially expanded. I can live with this though I am not crazy about it. Also, if I have had the grid open for a while and the user has collapsed some groups, as soon as a row is added programmtically, all the groups expand again -- this is even more troubling. How can I have better control of the expansion of groups? Thanks!\r\n",
