I&nbsp;need to validate some fields before the user save the data, i'm&nbsp;using the RowEditEnding event and in the case that the data has some field invalid, i show\r\n a message to the user and&nbsp;set the e.Cancel = true in the event to prevent the user leave the row. The problem is that the row change after the event, it's something like i didn't set e.cancel = true, and i need to force the user to stay in the row and\r\n solve the error before leave the row and submit the data to the DB.</p>\r\n<p>Can anybody help me please?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
