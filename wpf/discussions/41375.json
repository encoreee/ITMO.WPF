Our WPF Ribbon will not compile and run on Silverlight out-of-the-box. However, we are working on the scenario for Ribbon in XBAPs. The Silverlight team has also had a number of requests to implement a Ribbon so they're trying to prioritize that request and see how it fits in their schedule. @zappoo, a new Ribbon was promised a while ago but due to competing priorities (.NET 4, VS2010), Ribbon did not get much attention. We've been working on a new release and also our licensing approach. We will have an update towards the end of July 2010. @dgennetten, we will have an update towards the end of July 2010. But please note that the new release will be based on .NET 3.5 and not .NET 4. Having said that, one of our scenarios is to ensure that it can work with WPF4 applications as well. -Saied SaiedKhanahmadi Jun 17 at 5:16 PM</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>@DwhiteR1, we've addressed the RibbonWindow issues regarding minimize, maximize, dual-screen, and others for the upcoming release.</p>",
