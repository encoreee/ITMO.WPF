Specifically, I'd like to set the IsChecked state on various RibbonCheckBox items contained in the RibbonDropDownMenu.Items collection.</p>\r\n<p>So far, I can't get it.</p>\r\n<p>I've tried adding event handlers to the dropdown button's GotFocus, MouseDown, and Command.Executed events, no joy.</p>\r\n<p>So, what is the correct approach to doing this sort of thing?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",
