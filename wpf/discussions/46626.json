Basically, the combo side of things works OK, but once the focus is lost it loses the text. I have tried binding both Text in both the ElementStyle and EditableElementStyle to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre there any samples for this? I can email a small sample that shows the problem if needs be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nKent<br>\r\n",
