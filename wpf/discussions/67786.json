    "Html": "<p>I figured it out. This is not a bug. When you have controls such as textboxes that can have validation errors (and therefore a red border), if they live in an expander control or a tab control, you need to use <span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#0000ff\">&lt;</span></span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#a31515\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#a31515\">AdornerDecorator</span></span><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#0000ff\"><span style=\"font-size:x-small;color:#0000ff\">&gt; </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\">Here is the article: <a href=\"http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/wpf-validation-errors-disappear-inside-tabcontrol-when-switching-tabitems/\">http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/wpf-validation-errors-disappear-inside-tabcontrol-when-switching-tabitems/</a></span></p>",
