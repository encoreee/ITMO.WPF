The check could be something like making sure they input a number, or call some special business rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question I have is, I don't want this event to fire if they're leaving the normal viewing cell in the grid, I only want this to fire when they leave the textbox-type control inthe grid (after they've entered their value).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's the best way to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nChris\r\n",
