    "Html": "<p>Thanks Samantha for the quick reply!</p>\r\n<p>That's what I thought about the documentation. I did know about the walk through and also the hands on lab, but I wasn't aware of the Southridge Lab. I will have to check it out. I'll slog through the code and use Dotnet Reflector. Those will help too.</p>\r\n<p>The reason I'm so eager to use the Microsoft grid is that it is easy to deploy and has no restrictions about who can develop with it. I currently work on projects where the baton sometimes gets passed on to other developers. Making future developers buy a license to a commercial grid or even have to register for the &quot;free&quot; commercial grid doesn't work so well for my customers.</p>\r\n<p>Also, line of business apps don't work so well without a real grid.</p>\r\n<p>I'm hoping I can transition at least some of my business applications from winforms to wpf. WPF has excellent potential!</p>\r\n<p>--<br>\r\nPeter</p>\r\n",
