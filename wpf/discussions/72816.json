So, now I have screen full of pretty checkboxes, pretty expanders, pretty tab controls, pretty list boxes...and one ugly-duckling DataGrid.</p>\r\n<p>Out of curiosity, I also downloaded the Silverlight Toolkit because I noticed that *all* the controls were nicely themed. However, I apparently can't use the Silverlight stuff with WPF (I get some sort of &quot;invalid manifest&quot; compiler error).</p>\r\n<p>Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Is there something I can do to get the nicely themed Silverlight controls to work in WPF? Maybe even grab the source for the Silverlight DataGrid style and paste it into a ResourceDictionary? Has anyone tried anything like that?</p>\r\n<p>2. Does anyone have a nice theme or set of themes that works for *all* WPF native &amp; WPF Toolkit controls?</p>\r\n<p>3. Any other suggestions or ideas?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
