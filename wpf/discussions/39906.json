You can view it here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/WPFDataGridExamples.aspx<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that although the code snippets in the article do not demonstrate sychronisation of the grid with a group of text boxes, the cod download does. A few tips to get you looking in the right <br>\r\ndirection ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am assuming that you are binding to a collection of business objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. If your collection of objects is an ObservableCollection, all you have to do is add the new object to thw collection and your DataGrid will update accordingly.<br>\r\n2. If you have both your textboxes and DataGrid bound to the same collection, enable synchronisation via the IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem property of the DataGrid<br>\r\n3. If you have both your textboxes and DataGrid bound to the same collection thsi will happen automatically<br>\r\n4. Simply hit the Delete key!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nColin E. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n",
