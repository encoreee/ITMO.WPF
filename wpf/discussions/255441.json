I tried setting the ItemTemplate to a new AccordionItem, but this is wrapped inside the AccordionItem of the Accordion</p>\r\n<p>I also tried using a Converter to convert the Collection to a List of AccordionItem, but in this case I got exceptions in the Accordion itself.</p>\r\n<p>How can<em>&nbsp;</em>I achieve the Binding of Header of an AccordionItem?</p>\r\n<p>greets</p>\r\n",
