In other words fix the rows that display RowDetails no matter what happens on the DataGrid.</p>\r\n<p>So currently scrolling around closes the RowDetailsPanes that they have opened. What I would like to do is to have a checkbox in one of the columns and bind the RowDetails panel visibility to this property but I can't figure out how to do it. The problem is simply that RowDetailsPane only operates on the row selection(s) in the datagrid - can it be extended somehow to operate on a property of my choosing?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance, Will</p>\r\n</div>",
