<div class="wikidoc"><h1>DataGrid Feature Walkthrough Sample</h1>
This sample basically is like a runtime version of the cider experience for the properties view.  The sample has bound all the DataGrid and DataGridColumn properties to checkboxes, textboxes, comboboxes, etc so you can change them at runtime.  This will give you an idea of what specific DataGrid and DataGridColumn properties you have available to you and allow you to create configuration at runtime to see their behaviors quickly and easily.  The instance of the DataGrid is also created at runtime so you can restart the DataGrid instance with a clean slate at runtime as well.  There are also three different DataGrid examples where they use ObservableCollectionView, DataTable, and Linq to Sql as the data sources.  A variation of this sample was used by testers for small ad-hoc and to quickly reproduce particular scenarios.  You can download the sample from here, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/vinsibal/archive/2008/10/22/wpf-datagrid-and-the-wpftoolkit-have-released.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/vinsibal/archive/2008/10/22/wpf-datagrid-and-the-wpftoolkit-have-released.aspx</a>.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
