<div class="wikidoc"><h1>WPF Control Verifier Version 0.1</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>WPF Control Verifier is a tool that verifies the correctness of WPF Controls.  This tool is geared towards WPF Control developers with the goal of providing a set of verifications that all controls can run and consume.  Version 0.1 includes one category for verification â€“  default style verification.  These tests verify that your control can be styled such that its dependency properties are inheriting or template binding correctly.  Future versions will include additional categories of verification.   <br />
