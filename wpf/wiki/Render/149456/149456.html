<div class="wikidoc"><h1>WPF Codeplex Shared Source</h1>The WPF Codeplex site is part of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/default.mspx">Microsoft Shared Source Initiative</a>.  We will share source code for many of the components which we ship through the WPF Toolkit and WPF Futures.  Please note that Shared Source is not the same thing as Open Source.  For an explanation of the difference between Shared Source and Open Source, we recommend that you take a look at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/initiative/faq.mspx">Share Source FAQs</a>.  <br /><br />At this time, we do not accept community contributions and fixes.  We urge community members who author fixes to post the fixes to their blogs and/or attach them to Issues so that other developers may benefit from their work.  Though the WPF team cannot add community-authored fixes to the product at this time, we believe that community contributions are of great value to the entire WPF developer community.  At some point in the future, we hope to open up at least a portion of this site to take community contributions.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
