<div class="wikidoc"><h1>DataGrid Design Time</h1>
A design time experience is available for the WPF DataGrid in the Visual Studio Designer (codename &#39;Cider&#39;).  This design time will allow you to add/remove columns from your Columns collection and modify the properties of individual columns and the DataGrid itself.  Simply right-click on the DataGrid in the designer and use the options under the &quot;DataGrid&quot; menu item.<br /><br />In order to use the designer, you must install the WPF Toolkit using the WPFToolkit.msi installer, which will place design time dlls in a known location where the designer will look for them.  If the dlls are not in this location, you will not be able to use DataGrid in the designer.<br /><br /><b>Setting an ItemsSource</b><br />In order to edit bound columns in the Columns collection through the designer, the DataGrid must have a valid ItemsSource set (the designer can be used with unbound columns without setting the ItemsSource).  There is a limitation in the designer whereby you cannot bind to properties on the element you are designing.  If your DataGrid is not showing any columns in the Add/Remove Columns dialog but your project compiles and runs, your ItemsSource is most likely hitting this issue.  To learn how to solve this issue, please visit the <a href="https://wpf.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Design%20Time%20ItemsSource&referringTitle=Design%20Time">Design Time ItemsSource</a> page.<br /><br /><b>Viewing Data at Design Time</b><br />It is possible for to view the data in your DataGrid in the designer.   If the DataGrid control has a DataContext with data in it and the control is data bound, the data will display.  You can learn more about getting your data to display at design time in this <a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2008/10/11/viewing-design-time-data-in-visual-studio-2008-cider-designer-in-wpf-and-silverlight-projects/">blog post</a>.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
