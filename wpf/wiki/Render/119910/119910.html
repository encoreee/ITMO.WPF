<div class="wikidoc"><h1>DataGrid Known Issues: Sort Performance</h1>
DataGrid&#39;s built-in sort sometimes has less than optimal performance in certain scenarios, such as very large data sets (&gt;100,000 items, depending on your machine speed).  This is a result of the comparer in the built-in sort using reflection to perfom the sort, which is an expensive operation.  Reflection is necessary because the comparer does not know anything about your data type.  The DataGrid team is working on improving the performance of the built-in sort for our next release.  In the meantime, if you are experiencing poor sort performance in your application, we recommend that you implement a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Custom%20Sort&amp;referringTitle=Tips%20%26%20Tricks">custom sort</a>.<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
