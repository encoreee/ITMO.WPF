    "Description": "So I am using a Accordion control from the WPFToolkit. \n \nFirst I have a problem changing the data source on the accordion control so I fixed the issue by following the instruction listed below.\nhttp://wpf.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic?field=CreationDate&direction=Descending&issuesToDisplay=Open&keywords=accordion&emailSubscribedItemsOnly=false\n \nThis lead to a Infinite Loop which was caused in the OnSelectedItemPropertyChanged event, when IsValidItemForSelection is checked.\n \nif (!source.IsValidItemForSelection(newValue))\n            {\n                // reset to oldvalue\n                source._selectedItemNestedLevel++;\n                \n                /**\n                *Author: Jason Mogera\n                *Date: 2/11/2011\n                *Added Commented the bottom line out for it will cause a infinite loop.\n                *THe Accordian control doesn't work when the DataSOurce is changed dynamically. * \n                **/              \n                \n                //source.SetValue(SelectedItemProperty, oldValue);\n                source._selectedItemNestedLevel--;\n            }\n \nThis got my application running without the infinite loop, but now I am getting a behavior where the once an AccordionItem is collapsed, it doesn't expand anymore.\n \nPlease look at the example provided.",
