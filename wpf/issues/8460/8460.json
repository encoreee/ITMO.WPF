      "Message": "To follow up, the team discussed this bug and decided that it was By Design, since the Content property on a typical Button can be anything (text, image, etc.), whereas the RibbonButton has a specific layout which must be followed according to the guidelines, which requires you to use the LabelTitle, Small/LargeImageSource, etc. properties to achieve the correct look.  Therefore, our current plan is to ignore the Content property on all Ribbon controls.",
