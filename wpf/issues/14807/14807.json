    "Description": "This method uses a static nullable boolean to store the initial result of the check for whether an element is running under design time. This is a bad assumption. This check should always check the current value against an element. In our case, we have an application that has both a design time and run time interface. Using the cached result stored in the static yields some very unpredictable results (as well as crashing in a similar case).",
