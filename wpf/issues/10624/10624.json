    "Description": "I attached a screenshot of the error I get. It only seems to happen while using the designer (i.e., the application doesn't seem to fail the assert). Could have something to do with the visual area defined by the designer (i.e., maybe it uses an infinite width). Also, it only seemed to happen when I put the DataGrid in a GroupBox, but I didn't test it fully enough to confirm that. To reproduce, create a window called \"Window1\" and paste the below XAML into it. Your project will also require a reference to the WPF toolkit (my solution has the actual code for the WPF toolkit in a project, rather than just the compiled code). When you build, it show show a message box similar to the one in the attached screenshot. To get the message box to reappear, I had to modify the column width (i.e., retype the \"*\") and rebuild the project. When the project rebuilds after a modification to the width, the message box pops up again.\n \n \n<Window x:Class=\"MigrationTool_Tester.Window1\"\n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n    Title=\"Window1\"\n    xmlns:wpf=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Windows.Controls;assembly=WPFToolkit\">\n    <GroupBox>\n        <wpf:DataGrid\n            AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\">\n            <wpf:DataGrid.Columns>\n                <wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn>\n                    <wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>\n                        <DataTemplate>\n                            <Button>Hello</Button>\n                        </DataTemplate>\n                    </wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>\n                </wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn>\n                <wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn Width=\"*\">\n                    <wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>\n                        <DataTemplate>\n                            <Button>Hello</Button>\n                        </DataTemplate>\n                    </wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>\n                </wpf:DataGridTemplateColumn>\n            </wpf:DataGrid.Columns>\n        </wpf:DataGrid>\n    </GroupBox>\n</Window>",

      "Message": "I tend not to gree.   It might not effect the behavior of the DataGrid but in larger WPF projects with the WPF ToolKit i cannot complete a build because of VS \r\nerrors with out of memery exceptions.  \r\n\r\nWhen the availableStarSpace exception happens (the first time) i choose \"Ignore\" from the 3 choice offered in the dialogue about this exception.  Otherwise VS shuts down completely in exception.\r\n\r\nWhat i believe is happening (and this is eggregious on larger projects) is that, indeed, the excetion is ignore, and its (possible) repitition consumes resources in a large project to the point that it cannot link and compile ....\r\n\r\nI hope somebody will reply concerning this to schwartzenberg [a) gmail dot com\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaul",
