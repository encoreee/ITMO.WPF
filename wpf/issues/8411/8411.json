    "Description": "I'm using the Ribbon preview in conjunction with Composite Application for WPF framework.  I'm can load RibbonTabs from the Composite Modules, however, they are always added to the end of the Ribbon.  I would like to be able to Insert the RibbonTab between existing Tabs.  If I use the Tabs.Insert() it works fine before the Ribbon is initially displays (i.e. in the Shell constructor), but once the Ribbon displays, the Tabs are always added to the end, even when Inserting into the Collection.  \nIs there anyway to achieve this?",

I attached a simple project that shows we are able to add a new tab in the middle of tabs.  If you can still repro the bug, could you attach a simple repro?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWilliam ",
