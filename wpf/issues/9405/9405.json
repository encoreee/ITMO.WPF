    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI am creating a touchscreen keyboard using WPF. The keyboard should be supported for number of languages.\nSo my keyboard should show language dependent keys . For e.g.....when i change my system language to german, then german keyboard should appear instead of normal English keyboard.\nThe same feature is implemented in windows On screen Keyboard.\nCould anyone suggest me a way to achieve this.\n \nThanks\n \n \nCheers,\nSumit",

Also lot less people monitor issues when compared to discussions.\r\n\r\nYou might want to try http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/wpf/threads/ where more people discuss about overall WPF stuff.",
