    "Description": "I have an app that has a datagrid in it, which I have deployed with ClickOnce and have had running fine. This last time I have re-published the app it runs fine on several of my virtual machines, but 2 win2k8 servers just won't run it.\n \nAfter much digging I found it to be the WPF Datagrid. I've created a small app which runs fine on XP/Vista/Win7 and Win2k8, but always fails on these 2 virtual boxes. \n \nHas anyone seen this before and/or got any ideas how I could figure out how to find out what settings/config are different on these boxes. Please bear in mind that I have had the datagrid app running on these servers before. \n \nCheers, Mike...",
