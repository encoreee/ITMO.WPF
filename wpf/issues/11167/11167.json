    "Description": "I'm down to part 16 in the walkthrough - and am getting this error when I hover over my new item created. Example: Run the application, click on the coins dropdown (application menu) the one item that I added with this code (close button):\n<r:RibbonApplicationMenuItem>\n          <r:RibbonApplicationMenuItem.Command>\n             <r:RibbonCommand \n                LabelTitle=\"_Close\" \n                LabelDescription=\"Close the Application\"\n                Executed=\"OnCloseApplication\" />\n             </r:RibbonApplicationMenuItem.Command>\n          </r:RibbonApplicationMenuItem>\n       </r:RibbonApplicationMenu>\nÂ \nDoesnt Display Close in the button - its empty and then this exception is thrown. What up with that? Was there something I missed? \nThanks for any help,\nJosh",
