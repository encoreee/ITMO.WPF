    "Description": "Hi Everyone,\n \nI create a Converter for Datetime that allow the user to create a shortcut to enter a date. This converter allow the user to enter something like that\n          - 5M      To add 5 Months to the current day\n          - 2Y      To add 2 Years to the current day\n          - 4d      To add 4days to the current day\nThis converter has a Validator as well to be sure this work.\nWhen I bind a Datetime to a Textbox the convertion work fine.\nHowever, when I want to bind to a DatePicker, the validation step don't work. I set up the ValidationStep property to rawProposedValue, but the DatePicker take the priority.\n \nCould we have in case of on ValidationRules is setup have the priority on the DatePicker?\n \nthank you\n \nDavid.\n \nBTW: Thank you for your control. well design and simple to use.",

And if you guys bake this in, please make it localizable, or at least make it possible to supply your own abbreviations for the shortcuts. For example, for adding 5 years (+5Y), in Dutch I would like to use +5j ('jaar' is Dutch for 'year').",
