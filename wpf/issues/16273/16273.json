    "Description": "Hi Tool Kit Team,\n \nI am using WPF Toolkit in our project. In the WPF Data Grid when i set the user control in template columns the bindings are not updated properly.\n \nHerewith i have attached the project to reproduce the same. I have an entity with 4 columns (Name, DOB, DOJ and Status). I have set this entity as my DataGrid's Items Source.\n \nfor the DOB i have used the template column and in the editing template i have used Date Picker Control\nfor the DOJ i have used the template column and in the editing template i  have used my user control (date picker with masking features).\n \nIf i update the date in DOB via editing template  values are getting updated back in the source and cell  but the same is not working for DOJ.\n \nPlease have a look at the project attached and let me know, what is the cause and resolution.\n \nThanks in Advance.\n \nRegards,\nGopi V",
