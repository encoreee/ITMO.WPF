    "Description": "The memory leak happens with the following scenario and confirmed with CLRprofiler:\nÂ \nThe datagrid bound to the observable collection. Some worker thread every 2 seconds clears all rows of the observable collection and adds 2000 rows again.\nWhen the window is closed DependencyProperties are left behind.\nReplacing datagrid with ListView resolves the issue.\nSee the attached sample project.",
