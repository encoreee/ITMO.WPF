    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI experienced a problem with the AutoCompleteBox Component in 3.5.50211.1:\nWhen entering the \"search\" test, the ItemsSource list is updated in the Populating Event Handler (I also used FilterMode=\"Contains\"... same problem).\nWhen this list contains more than exactly 15 items, scrolling through the popup (or by using the arrow keys) brings up duplicates and other selected items differ from those I click at, but only from the 15th item on.\n \nIs this problem known or is there a workaround?\n \nBest regards,\nMichael",
