    "Description": "If multiple data grid row's are selected, and the user right clicks on one of the selected row headers, the data grid will change the selection to the clicked row.\n \nThat should only happen if the row is not already selected.\n \nContrast this with the behavior of right clicking on a cell, which behaves correctly.",

      "Message": "FYI: You can fix this by changing DataGrid.OnContextMenuOpening.\r\n\r\nThe \"if (rowHeader != null)\" part needs to check to see if parentRow.IsSelected, and if so, not call HandleSelectionForRowHeaderAndDetailsInput.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
