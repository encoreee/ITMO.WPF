    "Description": "It works fine if you use the click and drag method (one mouse click) but some users prefer to use a two click approach meaning - left click for the start date followed by a shift+left click for the end date.  \n \nwhen you try the two click approach it looks like you have selected the range you want but once the control loses focus you will see that only the first day has remains selected.  \n \nIs there a work around for this as it is common to use the two click approach.",
