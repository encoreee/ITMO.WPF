    "Description": "Hi,\nI'm upgrading my project from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.\nOne of my projects use WPFToolkit to use VisualStateManager. After changing the framework version I got error that the class VisualStateManager exist in both WpfToolkit and .NET 4.\n \nI've currently resolve the problem by removing the WPF Toolkit since I only needed it for the VisualStateManager but that might be a problem in the future.\n \nAre you going to release .NET 4 compatible library?\n \nThank you,\nIdo.",
