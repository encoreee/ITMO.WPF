      "Message": "Hello dozer,\r\n\r\nI would say that this is by design. This is the very nature of routed events. Scrollbar doesn't handle the DoubleClick hence gets bubbled to DataGrid. Technically we could handle the event on Scrollbar and do nothing, but then that would stop the users from doing the opposite of your scenario. You should probably have a handler on  Scrollbar and do nothing, or in the handler of DataGrid you can choose to ignore if the event arised from within ScrollBar.",
