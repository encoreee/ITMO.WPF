    "Description": "I bound SelectedDate to a dependency property on an object. Setting the object's property set the SelectedDate if no date was already set. Once set though, no changes to the property were detected by the DatePicker. Also, the object's property was never updated by changes in the DatePicker.\nÂ \nAttached is a simple WPF form demonstrating the problem. The Start property is bound to both a DatePicker and a TextBlock. There are two buttons to change the object's property. The DatePicker does not update correctly. The TextBlock does. Changing the DatePicker should cause the property to change, in turn causing the TextBlock to change.",
