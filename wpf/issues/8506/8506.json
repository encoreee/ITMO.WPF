Note also the ugly (imo) corners at that top. Is there some way to get those to look a little better.  Like if we could just remove the black line around the top left and right sides it would be pretty good.  Note that it is not there on the bottom side.  Is that something I can set?\r\n\r\nWhen is V1 coming?  Anybody know?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",
