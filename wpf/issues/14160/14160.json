    "Description": "RibbonWindow seems to disable title bar buttons  (such as minimize, maximize, close, and quick access command buttons) when primary monitor is second monitor (on the right) and secondary monitory is first (on the left) and RibbonWindow is located on the secondary monitor on the left. \n \nNone of the buttons get highlighted.\n \nAll other monitor configurations seem to work fine. Oh yeah, and there is famous maximize bug on Windows XP, when task bar gets covered by RibbonWindow.\n \nIt is under Windows XP SP3. \n \nI have not tried Vista or Windows 7. \n \nSome users have this monitor setup in our company and cannot use title bar buttons :(",
