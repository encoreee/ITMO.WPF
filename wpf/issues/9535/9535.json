    "Description": "There's neither property is set  after selecting a date in the DatePicker.\n \nI've run the WPFFeaturesPreviewHOLOnline Checkbookmanager, and there also, you can edit a date but it doesn't change after editing (when you leave the column the old date is displayed)...\n \nAll the other columns do change however?\n \nI'm running this in Belgium as it might be  a localization problem.\n \nIt seems pretty bizar that these properties should not work. That would mean nobody has been able to use the control...\n \nRegards,\n \nDave",
