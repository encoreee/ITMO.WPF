    "Description": "DatePicker lets user to enter time and correctly parses it and stores in its SelectedDate property, but subsequently clears the text presentation to Date-only.\n \nTo reproduce:\n \n        <UniformGrid>\n            <TextBox\n                Text=\"{Binding SelectedDate, ElementName=pick, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}\"\n                VerticalAlignment=\"Center\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\" Margin=\"8\"/>\n            <WpfToolkit:DatePicker x:Name=\"pick\"\n                VerticalAlignment=\"Center\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\" Margin=\"8\"/>\n        </UniformGrid>\n \nClick on DatePicker's textbox, type in 01/01/2009 10:30. Press Tab. The bound textbox on the right shows the correct DateTime value with time.\n \n \n \nWhat is wrong:\n \nThe data is expected to survive roundtrip from text to DateTime presentation, but it does not.\n \n \nProposed solution:\n \nDetect whether SelectedDate has non-zero time and format it with time in that case.\nSpecial handling also required when user chooses the date using mouse. In that case if before mouseclick SelectedDate had a non-zero time, the value after selection should accept the same TimeOfDay instead of going to 12:00 as of now.",

If you need the control to handle times, you'll need to subclass it or modify the source to be a DateTimePicker.",
