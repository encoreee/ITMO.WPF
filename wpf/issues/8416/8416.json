    "Description": "The code says:\n// TODO: Consider making a protected virtual.\n// If made public, look for PUBLIC_ONINPUT (in DataGridCell) and enable.\ninternal virtual void OnInput(InputEventArgs e)\n{\n}\n \nI don't know who had that todo on his worklist :), but we really need it to be able to make our own custom columns respond to textinput.\n \nIf it was not needed then why did the team use it in DataGridTextColumn as can been seen in its code snippet:\ninternal override void OnInput(InputEventArgs e)\n{\n     // Text input will start an edit\n      if (e is TextCompositionEventArgs)\n     {\n           BeginEdit(e);\n      }\n}\n \nplease make it protected in the DataGridColumn base class, i have now hacked it into my copy... or provide me with an alternative.\n \nbest regards,\n Jan Izaak Oosthoek",
