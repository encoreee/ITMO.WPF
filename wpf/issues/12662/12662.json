    "Description": "We just upgraded to the February Release and found a problem when using UIA with the DataGrid. When switching from display to editing mode, the UIA tree somehow is not updated and the cell has only one child - the TextBlock used in DisplayMode. Can you give me any hints on how to solve this?",
