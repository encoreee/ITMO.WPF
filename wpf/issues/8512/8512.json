    "Description": "I get the following error.  This seems like a bug in the DataGrid...\n \nInvalidOperationException: A TwoWay or OneWayToSource binding cannot work on the read-only property 'Bar' of type 'Foo'\n \nHere is the source...\n \n    internal class Foo\n    {\n        public string Bar\n        {\n            get { return \"Baz\"; }\n        }\n    }\n \n \n...and the OnInitialized in the window...\n \n \n    protected override void OnInitialized(EventArgs e)\n    {\n        base.OnInitialized(e);\n \n        var c = new ObservableCollection<Foo>();\n        c.Add(new Foo());\n        c.Add(new Foo());\n        c.Add(new Foo());\n        dgrEnums.ItemsSource = c;\n    }\n \n...and the XAML snippet...\n \n    <dg:DataGrid x:Name=\"dgrEnums\" \n                 HeadersVisibility=\"Column\"\n                 AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\">\n        <dg:DataGrid.Columns>\n            <dg:DataGridTextColumn Binding=\"{Binding Path=Bar, Mode=OneWay}\" Header=\"Enumeration\" />\n        </dg:DataGrid.Columns>\n    </dg:DataGrid>\n \nI'm setting the mode to OneWay.  However, it still fails saying that TwoWay and OneWayToSource cannot be used with readonly properties.\n \n \nAlso, note that I MUST put the HeadersVisibility=\"Column\" attribute.  If I leave it at the default, \"All\", I get a row header on the column row, but *not* on the item rows.  So, the cells don't line up with the column headers.\n \nIs there a list of known problems available for the DataGrid control?\n \n \nThanks,\nGary",

This is an implementation detail for row/cell editing to work correctly.  By setting IsReadOnly to true, the bindings will not set the Column to TwoWay.",
