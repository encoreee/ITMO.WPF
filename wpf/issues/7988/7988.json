      "Message": "This is a bug in VisualStateBehaviorFactory, part of VSM. This class is not going to be in .NET 4.0 and is only in the Toolkit to provide GoToState calls for some known types. In .NET 4.0, the controls will have the GoToState calls natively, which is why this class will not be used.\r\n\r\nRegardless, we have filed a bug in our internal database.",
