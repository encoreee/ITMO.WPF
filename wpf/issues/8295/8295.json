    "Description": "Hello, Bootstrapper doesn’t seem to properly add itself to the RunOnce key to run after reboot to continue setup. It does create a key named 'AH Setup Bootstrapper' and the value is only '  - resume', no path name is specified. If I manually add the full path to the setup.exe in temp folder and remove the –resume postfix, setup is launched on next reboot. Is this a known issue? Happens on Vista and XP. Any special configuration is required to get proper reboot handling?\n \nThe log files look good, only mention .net installer requesting a reboot on success. I am doing an 'Immediate' reboot on the .net package, this is required for a successful install of the app package (which is actually forced by a problem with ClickOnceInstaller.exe attempting to load .net 3.5 methods which don't exist without a reboot).\n \nCheers!",
