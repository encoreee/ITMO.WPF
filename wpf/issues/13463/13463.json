    "Description": "Create a ListBox and attempt to set HorizontalContentAlignment to something other than left (e.g. Stretch). When ExpressionDark is active, the content aligns left regardless. Disabling ExpressionDark allows HorizontalContentAlignment to work properly. I temporarily got around this by setting HorizontalAlignment to Stretch in the theme file, but this is not a fix.",
