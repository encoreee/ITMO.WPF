      "Message": "The error is \"Strong name validation failed\" and fuslogvw doesn't show any binding errors, so it's obviously not a missing dependency issue.\r\n\r\nThe problem may be that MS used partial signing and deployed the partially-signed assembly.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to disable strong-name verification in a VS command prompt as follows:\r\n\r\nsn -Vr \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Client Profile Configuration Designer\\cpdesign.exe\"\r\n\r\nObviously replace the path to cpdesign.exe if it's different on your system.",
