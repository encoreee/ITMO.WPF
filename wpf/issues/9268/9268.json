      "Message": "Hi scottwis,\r\n\r\nI just wanted to express that the Issue Tracker database is not, in fact, a black hole. :-)  Members of the WPF team read every post to both the Issue Tracker and Discussions forum on a daily basis.  While we do our best to respond to as many issues as possible, unfortunately there is not enough time in the day to reply to each and every one.  However, even if we haven't replied, it doesn't mean that we haven't taken note of the issue.  We have multiple internal bug and feature request databases which we use to track issues with the WPF Toolkit components, and we've added many bugs and requests to those databases based on posts that developers have added to this Issue Tracker and the Discussions.  We haven't gotten a chance yet to do the housekeeping of sifting through all of the Issue Tracker posts and resolving/closing/updating them as necessary, but we will do this at some point.  In the meantime, please continue to post any issues you come across to either the Discussions forum or the Issue Tracker.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSamantha",
