    "Description": "In addition to id# 9585.\nAlthough I just shortly work with WPF and my knowledge of it is still increasing, I made the following observation (and maybe not completely correct) :\n \nWhen the DatePicker looses focus, invalid data wil automatically be reset to the last date. Since it is it rather SelectedDate-based than Text-based. \nMaybe the user accidently 1-122-2009 instead of 1-12-2009. He can change his mistake by only removing this single character...\n... or instead I should do some key-previewing. \nAlso other controls tend to do this. You see this behaviour also in other software, so maybe I have to get used to it. \n \nIn my opinion the Binding should stay in a sort of errorstate where refreshing temporarily is froozen.\nBut you cannot change properties after binding. Why?\nAnd you can not inherit the Binding, other than like this: http://www.hardcodet.net/2008/04/wpf-custom-binding-class. Why?\nObject Orientation is not ment - I think - to seal so much off. After several years of experience I know that I cannot forsee everything, or how things will be used.\n \nGreetings Eric Gehring,\nwww.softex.nl",
