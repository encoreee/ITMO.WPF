      "Message": "Actually, Grid does have a Background property.  However, I was getting this error, as well, but once I modified the source code per your change above, the error went away.   Very strange.  I am curious how you narrowed it down to this line of code.  I have System.Xaml.pdb loaded, but it won't show me the source code where the error is occuring, so I had no idea how to narrow it down.  ",

      "Message": "You're right: Grid does have a Background property, and so does LayoutTransformControl (via its base class Control). Probably, the reason for the failure to resolve the property is the missing TargetType on the ControlTemplate. I don't remember how I narrowed it down to that line of code, this bug is almost a year old now (and nothing's been done about it).",
