    "Description": "I think there's a memory leak in the DatePicker of WPF Toolkit (October 2008 Release).\n \nI've attached a simple WPF application project (using VS2008SP1) to demonstrate this problem. Further, a profiler is needed to see what's going on inside (I'm using .NET Memory Profiler 3.1).\n \nBasically, in the application there are two windows: Window1 and ChildWindow1. In the Window1, there's a Button to open ChildWindow1. In the ChildWindow1, there's a DatePicker. Everytime ChildWindow1 is opened and closed (using the Window1's Button), its instances remain in the memory (indicates a memory leak) since there's always a reference that hold to the DatePicker. If I remove the DatePicker from the ChildWindow1, the ChildWindow1 is released appropriately. Also, when I open the ChildWindow1 for the first time, it shows up a little bit longer than I expected (compared to other simple controls). I presume there's also a performance issue in it.",
