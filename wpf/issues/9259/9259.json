    "Description": "The implementation of DataGrid.OnCanExecuteDelete contains \"CurrentCell.IsValid\" in conditions it requires in order to delete cells in the grid.\n \nThat is not correct behavior. It's possible, via the WPF command infastructure, to invoke the \"select all\" command without any cell in a data grid ever receiving focus. This results CurrentCell.IsValid returning false. If this happens, however, it should still be possible to delete rows from the grid using the grid's delete command.\n \nYou can fix this by removing \"CurrentCell.IsValid\" from the conditions in  DataGrid.OnCanExecuteDelete.",
