    "Description": "Currently it is practically impossible to do programatic scrolling of the DataGrid. I suggest either making the \"InternalScrollHost\" public so we can use the scrolling methods - or - create pass-through methods so we can call the following methods directly on the DataGrid which then would call the appropriate method on the InternalScrollHost.\nÂ \nScrollToBottom()\nScrollToEnd()\nScrollToHome()\nScrollToHorizontalOffset(double offset)\nScrollToLeftEnd()\nScrollToRightEnd()\nScrollToTop()\nScrollToVerticalOffset(double offset)",
