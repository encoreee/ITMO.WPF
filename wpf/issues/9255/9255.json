      "Message": "Hi Samantha, I found a solution that seems to work and is a bit simpler than handling the click event. In the DataGrid CellEditEnding event I check to see if the EditingElement is a TextBox, and if it is, and it's ContextMenu.IsOpen flag is set to true, I just cancel the Edit Ending event and it works.\r\n\r\nOne problem I am having is that by default the ContextMenu property of a TextBox is null. I think there is some sort of default context menu handler that handles the event and shows the popup. However this means that my solution only works if I explicitly create a context menu and assign it to this textbox (in the PreparingCellForEdit event)  or assign one in the style for the EditingElement for TextBox columns. \r\n\r\nI'm alright with this, but I would prefer not to use a custom ContextMenu, but to instead explicitly assign the default context menu for text boxes. \r\n\r\nDo you know how to get a reference to that (the default context menu for text boxes)?\r\n\r\n",
