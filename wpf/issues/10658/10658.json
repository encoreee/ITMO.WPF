    "Description": "I have a modal dialog opened and I am moving it. An event occurs and another modal dialog is opened. Now, I can't move the newly opened modal dialogs. When I close the newly opened modal dialogs, the modal dialog that I was moving comes back where I started to move it.\nÂ \nAn easy way to reproduce it is to create a DispatcherTimer that opens a modal dialog when the time is elapsed. Main window has a button that starts that timer and another button that opens a modal dialog. First, you click on the button that opens a modal dialog in 5 seconds, let say. Then, you click on the button that opens the other modal dialog. You move the first modal dialog and when the timer is elapsed, you will see that the new modal dialog can't be moved.",
