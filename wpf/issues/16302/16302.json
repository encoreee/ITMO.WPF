    "Description": "The GridLines get updated in OrientedAxisGridLine.cs Invalidate() before the positions of the GridLines are calculated in CategoryAxis.cs RenderOriented().\n \nI think I solved the issue doing this below.  However, using this solution below with the ChartBuilder demo software after you switch to BarSeries (also have to set the ShowGridLines to True in code) the grid lines do not show up. The grid lines are there, just can't see them because their Stroke is null. This is because in the OrientedAxisGridLines.cs ctor _gridLinePool = new ObjectPool<Line>(() => new Line { Style = Axis.GridLineStyle }); the GridLineStyle is null for some reason I don't know.  This solution still works for me in my application.\n \nprotected override IEnumerable<UnitValue> GetMajorGridLineCoordinates(Size availableSize)\n        {\n            if (Categories.Count > 0)\n            {\n                double maximumLength = Math.Max(GetLength(availableSize) - 1, 0);\n                for (int index = 0; index < Categories.Count; index++)\n                {\n                    double lower = ((index * maximumLength) / Categories.Count) + 0.5;\n                    yield return new UnitValue(lower, Unit.Pixels);\n                }\n                yield return new UnitValue(maximumLength + 0.5, Unit.Pixels);\n            }\n        }\n \nThanks,\nJordan Dressman",
