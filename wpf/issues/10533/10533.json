    "Description": "When I quickly scroll a DataGrid which is virtualizing rows I get the following:\n \nSystem.OverflowException: Arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow.\n   at System.IntPtr.op_Explicit(IntPtr value)\n   at System.Windows.Interop.HwndMouseInputProvider.FilterMessage(IntPtr hwnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, Boolean& handled)\n   at System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource.InputFilterMessage(IntPtr hwnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, Boolean& handled)\n   at MS.Win32.HwndWrapper.WndProc(IntPtr hwnd, Int32 msg, IntPtr wParam, IntPtr lParam, Boolean& handled)\n   at MS.Win32.HwndSubclass.DispatcherCallbackOperation(Object o)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.InternalRealCall(Delegate callback, Object args, Boolean isSingleParameter)\n   at System.Windows.Threading.ExceptionWrapper.TryCatchWhen(Object source, Delegate callback, Object args, Boolean isSingleParameter, Delegate catchHandler)\n \nI'm running on Vista x64.\nIf I don't scroll quickly, it doesn't happen.\nIf I don't use virtualization, it doesn't happen.\nIt is not dependant on what is happening to the grid at the time (i.e. if it is being updated)\n \nI've attached a project that reproduces the issue.\nJust build/run and quickly move mouse scroll wheel down.\n \nThanks,\nJan",
