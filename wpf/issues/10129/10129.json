    "Description": "I have a comboBox like so:\n<ComboBox Grid.Row=\"2\" Grid.Column=\"1\" Name=\"cboILWPortfolio\"\n                        ItemsSource=\"{Binding ILWPortfolioList.ILWPortfolios}\"\n                        DisplayMemberPath=\"ILWPortfolioName\"\n                        SelectedValuePath=\"ILWPortfolioID\"\n                        SelectedItem=\"{Binding ILWPortfolioList.SelectedILWPortfolio}\">\n</ComboBox>\nÂ \nThe ItemsSource is bound to an ObservableCollection.  Normally this displays a list of portfolios nicely in my dropdown list.  When I apply BureauBlue or WhistlerBlue themes, I no longer see the portfolio names.  Instead I see the Data Type of what the ComboBox ItemsSource is bound to.",

If you comment out this in BureauBlue.xaml (combobox section):\r\n <!--<ContentPresenter x:Name=\"contentPresenter\" Content=\"{TemplateBinding Content}\" ContentTemplate=\"{TemplateBinding ContentTemplate}\" HorizontalAlignment=\"{TemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment}\" Margin=\"{TemplateBinding Padding}\" />-->\r\n\r\nand put this in instead:\r\n\r\n<ContentPresenter HorizontalAlignment=\"{TemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment}\" VerticalAlignment=\"{TemplateBinding VerticalContentAlignment}\" Margin=\"5,2,0,2\"/>\r\n\r\nit will work!!\r\n",

The hard coded Margin you have put in might become a problem  - I suspect the original author intended Margin=\"{TemplateBinding Margin}\"\r\n\r\nzoltek - The problem is that the ToString() method was being used to display the combobox item and not the DisplayMemberPath as you would expect from the xaml.\r\n\r\nAnyone - Can anyone explain what is going on under the hood here causing this?",
