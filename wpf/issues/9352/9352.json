In large, all letters below the base line of text are cut off.  In this screenshot, those are j, q, and y for illustration purposes.  Specifying Height does not do anything.\n \nI apologize if this is a duplicate issue, but I don't see anyone discussing this problem or any workaround.  Please help.",
