    "Description": "In the M-V-VM toolkit v0.1 the ViewModelBase implements the INotifyPropertyChanged event and provides a simple OnPropertyChanged method that allows the developer to pass the property name as string.\n  \nThe problem of this simple approach is that it is not refactoring save and it is error prone because the compiler doesnâ€™t check if the property name string is correct. Better solutions are described here:\n  \n  \nBest Practices: How to implement INotifyPropertyChanged right?\nhttp://compositeextensions.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=53731 \n  \n   \njbe",
