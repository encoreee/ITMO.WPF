To see this, maximize a ribbonwindow, for example one of the samples and compare it to al normal window.\n \nThank you.",

When using a background in tandem with the RibbonWindow it still draws up into the title bar, sometimes rendering over the maximize/minimize/close window buttons (though those can still be clicked on).  I'm attaching a screenshot of it.  All the window is doing is putting a gradient background in Grid.Background and then changing WindowState.",
