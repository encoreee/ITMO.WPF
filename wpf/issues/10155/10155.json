    "Description": "I tried using the Listbox GroupStyle with an Expander as my GroupItem and it doesn't seem to work with most all of the themes. It displays the Expander's header but the items do not show up...\n \n<ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type GroupItem}\">\n<Expander IsExpanded=\"True\" ExpandDirection=\"Down\">\n<Expander.Header>\n<TextBlock>\n<TextBlock FontWeight=\"Bold\" Text=\"{Binding Path=Name}\"/> (<TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Path=ItemCount}\" />)\n</TextBlock>\n</Expander.Header>\n<ItemsPresenter Margin=\"5,0,0,0\" />\n</Expander>\n</ControlTemplate>\n \nAny ideas about how to get this working?",
