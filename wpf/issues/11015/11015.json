    "Description": "I have been tracing some problems with the Southridge \"DataGrid\" sample (the grid does not populate with data). The problem was I had the solution set to \"Any CPU\" but I had 32 bit SQL Server Compact Edition Binaries (which installed with VS 2008). After I did some testing, in which I created a console app and created an ADO.NET entity referecing the Southridge db. As soon as I instanciated the Entity an exception was immediatly thrown: \"The specified store provider cannot be found in the configuration, or is not valid.\" \nÂ \nAfter some KB / BLOG searches I found that I needed to change the platform to x86 (or possibly install the 64 bit version).",
