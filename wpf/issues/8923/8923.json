    "Description": "Unfortunately, the way a window renders in XP is shocking:\n \nCustom Chrome (what I use): Windows classic style, only it looks like someone took a PHOTO of a windows classic window, and then tried to fix it\nLuna: Looks REMOTELY like the Luna style, buttons are very wrong, so is the window background etc.\n \nAs I see it, there are two solutions to this issue:\n \n* Always render in a universal style (like Aero, Aero minus transparency, an Office 2007 style(s) etc)\n* Work with the given chrome rather than faking it badly\n \nReally, I would not dream of using this control until this issue is out of the road.",
