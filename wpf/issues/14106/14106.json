      "Message": "What is interesting, you can hide this exception by changing this AccordionItem e.g. by adding space and Visual Studio will recalculate xaml structure. Added space could be removed and still no exception will be thrown as long as the project won't be built or design view won't be closed and reopened. But then add and remove space to hide exception again...",

I fixed this by simply adding:\r\n\r\nif (ParentAccordion == null) return;\r\n\r\nabove line 714. HOWEVER, this is simply me working around it and getting on with life. This is by no means the real way of dealing with this issue or any sort of real solution. I wouldn't use this in production, just in case :P",
