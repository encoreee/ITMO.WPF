If you make ListEntity derive from ObservableCollection instead of MultiThreadingObservableCollection, then the application does not produce the exception. The issue likely arises due to the asynchronous reporting of collection changes, which is causing confusion within the control because the data is in one state while the visual containers are in another.",
