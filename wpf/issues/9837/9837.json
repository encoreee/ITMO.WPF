      "Message": "Virtualization works when you can calculate the total size of a bunch of items without knowing all their information. When you're grouping items, you need to know about each of them before you can work out group placement. This makes it incompatible with virtualization as a concept.",

      "Message": "Thanks Divelements.  Yes, as Divelements said, this is a known issue with the WPF platform.  We have a sample solution available for the general case which you can find here: http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/getwpfcode/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1142, but note that it will take some work to enable this on DataGrid (I don't believe we have a sample available w/ DataGrid at this time).  This is a problem which we hope to address better in a future release of WPF, but we do not have any set plans at the moment.  I'm closing the bug since we won't be fixing this in DataGrid in this release.",
