    "Description": "Even if the grid doesn't display any scrollbar, it handles the mouse wheel events and stop their propagation. Here's an example:\nPut lots of content inside a scrollviewer, including a grid. The grid itself should not have scrollbars.\nNow, everywhere you can use your mouse wheel to scroll up and down the scrollviewer; but not on the datagrid!\nÂ \nCorrect behaviour should be: if the gridview has scrollbars, it handles the mouse wheel. Otherwise, it should let it propagate up in the control hierarchy.",
