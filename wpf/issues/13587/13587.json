    "Description": "Given a large data set represented as a bar chart, can we get the ability to freeze the y-axis while scrolling horizontally across the x-axis and plot area. This is a better user experience than trying to cram too much data into a limited space while retaining the context of the y-axis. There should probably be support for freezing either axis as you could conceivably want to freeze the x-axis and vertically scroll the y-axis depending on the data.",
