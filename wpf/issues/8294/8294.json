    "Description": "Hello, ClickOnceInstaller.exe seems to have an obvious problem, I'm using version 3.5.30606.0 which as far as I can tell is the one included in the latest release of the Configuration Designer, however the seemingly newer ClickOnceInstaller.exe version 3.5.30729.1 gotten from the PREVIEW release of the client profile installer off download.ms.com does not have this issue. \n \nOn Vista 0x86 with 3.5SP1 get the following exception every time:\n \nCould not load file or assembly 'ClickOnceInstaller, Version=3.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. Strong name validation failed. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8013141A)\n \nShould we be using the newer versioned ClickOnceInstaller.exe from the preview bootstrapper release? However the bootstrapper is the other way around, lower version number, larger file and seems to work better...\n \nAny idea when the next update is coming to these tools?\nThank you.",

Only place I can find it is http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=14962.\r\n\r\nFrom your reply I can only assume neither of the version are the latest releases. Link?",

      "Message": "Indeed, the latest version (release 14962) does indeed have the exception I reported. Please take a look again, it is not fixed! Also without explicit support for reboot survival, I would say the installer will fail its primary mission for possibly 50% of users, making it quite useless.",
