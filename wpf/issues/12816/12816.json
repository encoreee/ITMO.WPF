    "Description": "I have a chart using a LineSeries that has a DateTime object as its independent value. For some reason, when I maximize the window the control is in, the date stops being displayed as \"4/4/2010\" and just shows \"12:00 PM\" or \"12:00 AM\" instead. \n \nIf I resize the window to the same size(as opposed to maximizing the window), then this isn't an issue. It only occurs when the window is maximized.\n \nMy data source isn't anything special, it's only ever set once. There's nothing special about the chart either, I haven't styled it or altered it in any way other than setting the independent value and dependent value on the series.",
