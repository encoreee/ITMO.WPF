    "Description": "Hi,\nI have created RibbonComboBox and ItemsSource is binded to ObservableCollection. Everything works, but when the window size is decreased and RibbonGroup is collapsed, then ItemsSource of RibbonGalleryCatogory is null and Combo is empty.\nI have tried it on the last version (October) and the previous too.\nSee attached project.\nBest regards Lukas",
