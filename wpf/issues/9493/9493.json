When using the Tab-key to get to the datepicker the text is correctly selected.",

      "Message": "This looks like a bug in the DatePicker to me.\r\n\r\nI ran into the same issue with setting the Target property of a label with an accelerator key to a date picker. Hitting the accelerator key doesn't focus the control. Also calling .Focus() directly doesn't do it either.\r\n\r\nYou can fix the bug if you download the source code, and add the following code to DatePicker.cs\r\n\r\n    protected override void OnAccessKey(AccessKeyEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        _textBox.Focus();\r\n    }",
