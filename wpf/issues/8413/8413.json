All subsequent changes in Controls collection have no effect.\nÂ \nAs a workaround, you may specify ItemsPanel and operate with its Children collection directly.\nBut in this case there's an issue: added items are disabled (visually, IsEnabled property is 'true') until you click somewhere in Ribbon.",
