    "Description": "If you clear an ObservableCollection to which an Accordion is bound (or set it to a new collection instance), the application will crash.\n \nThe source of the bug is in Accordion.UnselectItem, which is called from ClearContainerForItemOverride when the collection is cleared.\n \nAt line 1158 of Accordion.cs, the line checks if index < count.  It should be checking for index <= count.  This fixes the problem.",
