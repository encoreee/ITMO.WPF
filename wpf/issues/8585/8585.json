      "Message": "Hi Jeremy,\r\n\r\nWe will not be implementing Paste in the DataGrid since in trying to design the feature, we found that any operation outside of the simple case of pasting a single cell could have multiple different behaviors and was very app-specific, so we decided to leave this up to app authors.  However, we included the OnPastingCellClipboardContent method as a convenience for developers who wished to implement Paste.  You can find instructions for implementing Paste functionality here: http://blogs.msdn.com/vinsibal/archive/2008/09/19/wpf-datagrid-clipboard-paste-sample.aspx.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSamantha",
