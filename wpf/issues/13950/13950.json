    "Description": "I am having problems with the RibbonWindow from the new WPF ribbon release.\n \nIt does not always display properly as shown in the attached screenshot.  Once the screen is minimized and then maximized again, it displays fine.\n \nHas anyone else had this problem?  As a workaround, I have had to use the standard Window instead of RibbonWindow, which is not ideal.\n \nN.B.  I am running Windows 7 64 bit, in 32 bit mode, and have some win forms controls on the main window.",

(Note that I am running it on Windows7 64 bit in x86 Release configuration)\r\nI have not had time to determine whether the problem lies in the Ribbon or the docking framework, however I do know that when I change RibbonWindow to Window, everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs as soon as the main window opens.\r\n\r\nThanks, John",
