      "Message": "Funny it is, the coming year of testing we are going to write testscenarios for these, to set an example ...\r\n... just kidding: we are only human.\r\n\r\nI had this behaviour too. In my case it only happened when I had Widths (also Min and Max) set for my columns, Maybe TemplateColumns , I didn't test for that. \r\nMy workaround came by accident when I - in order to make only row accessible and editable at the time - wanted to set each row its IsEnabled-property individually, If you like that as a temporarily solution, search in Visibal's blogs for that. Best you set that property and others on the events that are there for you, like f.e the loading,of a row, rather than somewhere else. When data is not yet loaded or the grid is not directly visible (f.e. on a nonselected tabpage) not every item returns a row inmediately. A disadvantage is that you maybe have to disable more behaviour. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nEric Gehring\r\nwww.softex.nl",
