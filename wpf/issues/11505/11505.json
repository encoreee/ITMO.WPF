    "Description": "I have datatemplate columns in a datagrid and they have textblock and textbox as celltemplate and celleditingtemplate respectively. I have also implemented single click editing by copying the code DataGridCell_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown from this site.  But I am still having two click twice, once - to select the cell and the second time to select the textbox. Is there any way to single click and be able to edit the text box?\nÂ \nThanks\nAngelo",
