    "Description": "I'm having many troubles trying to programmatically add/remove hyperlinks to a standard WPF RichTextBox control.\n \nThe problems I'm encountering:\n \n- addHyperlink functionality should understand if the user has selected any word/paragraph inside the textbox, and then apply Hyperlink to selected text only. Again, if the user selected only the RichTextBox control (and not any text inside it), the Hyperlink must be applied to the whole text;\n \n- removeHyperlink functionality should remove Hyperlinks on selected text / selected control, accordingly to \"addHyperlink\" behaviour;\n \n- removeHyperlink should only remove link (and also the blue/underlined text effect), but not all font styles and other text attributes setted by user;\n \n- it would be useful, even if not strictly necessary, an additional function that lists all Hyperlinks contained in a single RichTextBox control.\n \nDoes anyone share my needs? Would this issue become a useful feature request?\nThank in advance, bye. Valentina",
