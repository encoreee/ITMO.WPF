    "Description": "If a DataGrid control is created without a name, WPF throws the following exception: \"Cannot find type 'Windows.Controls.DataGrid'. The assembly used when compiling might be different than that used when loading and the type is missing.\"\nÂ \nTo reproduce: Create a WPF window and add a DataGrid to the layout root. Delete any x:Name property added to the the control. Run the project, and the exception will be thrown. Add an 'x:Name=\"myGrid\"' property and re-run the project. The exception will not be thrown.",
