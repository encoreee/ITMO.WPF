      "Message": "Thank you for reporting this issue.  To workaround this problem, you can handle the AutoGeneratingColumns event and manually check to see if the Browsable attribute is set to false, and if so, you can cancel the generation of that column.  \r\n\r\nThough we agree that this is a bug, since there is a simple workaround and we have a large number of higher priority fixes, I'm going to close this issue and punt it to a later release.  Thank you!",
