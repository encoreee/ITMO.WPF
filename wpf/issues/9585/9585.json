    "Description": "Currently DatePicker can recognize empty string as NULL, but it does not do that with whitespace-only string.\nÂ \nFrom user experience perspective it is almost impossible to tell space from empty string (completely impossible if the application does not have focus). The control should preserve smooth user experience for the price of more programmatic checks.",
