    "Description": "The data grid control does not override OnAccessKey.\n \nThis gives different behavior for \"entering\" a data grid for tab navigation vs \"entering\" a datagrid via an accelerator key.\nUsing tab navigation, the first cell in the grid will receive focus.\n \nUsing an accelerator key to access the grid will only put focus on the grid its self, and will not enter the first cell of the grid.\n \nBoth means of navigation should probably be consistent with each other. I.e. either both should just focus the grid or both should just focus the cell.",
