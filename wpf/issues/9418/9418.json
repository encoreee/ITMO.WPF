    "Description": "Copy the default for a CalendarDayButton from generic.xaml. Locate the template, which contains a grid element. Set a margin on that grid element (so the days can be spaced further apart).\n \nSwitch to the  year or decade mode and observe the offset/shrunken grid.\n \nIt should be possible to modify the CalendarDayButton template without affecting the year or decade view.\n \nThis bug is also observed if items are placed into the template (a second grid with more rows/usercontrols/textblocks/etc.), causing the button to expand in any direction.\n \nNote: For the attached screenshots the calendar control was placed in a Viewbox with Stretch set to Fill, however, the bug is visible without the use of a Viewbox.",
