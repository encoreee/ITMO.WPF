    "Description": "Received a null reference exception in OverrideDataRange in DateTimeAxis. The method GetMaxLeftAndRightOverlap can return null for either maxLeftOverlapValueMargin or maxRightOverlapValueMargin in edge cases and the condition of the \"while\" after the call does not check for this. The same is true in LinearAxis. \n \nA very simple fix is to change the condition in both cases to:\n \nwhile ((maxLeftOverlapValueMargin != null && maxRightOverlapValueMargin != null) && (maxLeftOverlapValueMargin.LeftOverlap > 0 || maxRightOverlapValueMargin.RightOverlap > 0))\n \nThis seems to resolve this.",
