    "Description": "We are currently developing a multi-targeting Silverlight/Xbap application and suffering from datagrid incompatibility. To be more precise we have a requirement for highlighting cells that were changed. We built a class that listens among others to CellEditEnded event in Silverlight - it's the only event where we can get access to currently edited cell in view mode and highlight it. We didn't find workarounds neither... btw CellEditEnding sometimes passes null for EditingElement (sorry, no details for that as another developer is working detected the issue). Is that functionality planned for release?\nÂ \nThanks",
