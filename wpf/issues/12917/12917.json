    "Description": "The DataPointSeries classes do not properly give up their references when they should. I've been trying to pinpoint it, but there are instances where DataPointSeries will never call DetachEventHandlersFromDataPoint. I would expect it to absolutely call it when I clear the ObservableCollection I use for its ItemsSource, but it never does.",
