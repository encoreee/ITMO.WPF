It is very strange that the behaviour depends on the Mode property.\n \n2) IDataErrorInfo:\n \n- if Mode=TwoWay: the setter of this[string columnName] is called 4 times when a binding is modified - 2 times with the old value in argument and 2 times with the new value; then the binded property is finally set to the new value;\n- if Mode=TwoWay: this[string columnName] is called 9 times (!) when a binding is modified - 5 times with the old value in argument and 4 times with the new value; then the binded property is finally set to the new value.\n \nWe would expect the property setter of this[string columnName] to be only called once, with the new value.",
