    "Description": "If I derive a new panel and include it in a RibbonWindow, the available size provided to MeasureOverride is PositiveInfinity, PositiveInfinity.  The same derived panel in a standard Window gets the correct available size.  I have attached a trivial application that demonstrates the problem.  You can toggle it back and forth between RibbonWindow and Window to see the issue.  This sounds like it might be related to issue 9582, though I can't be sure.  Is the fix for this something that will not be available until V1 in Q4 or 2010 Q1?\nÂ \nThanks",
