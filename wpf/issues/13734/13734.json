    "Description": "Originally i was having problems with blue dots in the corners of my AccordionItems. I found a fix here: http://wpf.codeplex.com/workitem/12109\n \nThe fix was to change the bug in the source code and then rebuild. This i did and it got rid of the blue dots but a new bug arose. \n \nNow if you have an Accordion whose VerticalAlignment is set to stretch then AccordionItems do not expand. After debugging i found that when set to stretch the methods which calculate the Items needed height are not called.\n \nI created a small project to demonstrate this. \n \nAll i have done is rebuild the source code changing one background property from \"Blue\" to \"Transparent\". I have not changed anything else. This also proves that the source code is not the same as the code used to make the DLL's which you can download. \n \nSo when you run this project with the new DLL's which i built (in folder called DLL in application folder) you will see the stretch problem.\n \nThere is a style that i created int the project which overcomes this but then AccordionItems HorizontalAlignment has some problem. This is due to the face the the Accordion sets its child Items styles from the default style. This can be overcome.",
