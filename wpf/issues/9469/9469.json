And the fact that WPF ignores them both, didn't help either ;-)\r\nI found this trick (http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/04/wpf-tips-1-have-all-your-dates-times.html) and together with CurrentCulture I think I can manage my requirements.\r\nBut I also have a 'wanted' list, which has a similar feature like in Outlook (2007): the dates in Outlook automatically change format on the fly, as soon as you change the regional settings in your control panel. The trick from Sebastien only works once at the start of your application, so I probably have some more research to do...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMarcel",
