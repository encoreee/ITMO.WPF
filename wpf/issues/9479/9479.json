    "Description": "In an attempt to make a \"Today\" button (to move the focus of the Calendar to today's date), I execute the statement as follows:\n  calendarPicker.SelectedDate = Date.Time.Now\n \nThis works fine as long as the today's month is shown.  If a different month is shown, the focus leaves the view and the month doesn't update.\n \nExpected behavior would be that the month changes to the current month and the highlighted date changes to the current date.",

      "Message": "The behavior you are experiencing is by design to allow more flexability. If you set the SelectedDate to DateTime.Now, the SelectedDate (in the model) will be DateTime.Now but the view will not channge because DisplayDate hasn't been changed. So, you can either change the DisplayDate if you want it shown, or you can change the SelectedDate as well if you wanted it shown and selected.\r\n\r\n-Eric, MSFT\r\n",
