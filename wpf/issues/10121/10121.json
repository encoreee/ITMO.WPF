    "Description": "Just an FYI.\n \nI was working with defining a button to sit beside my row.  when the rowdetails are expanded for any given row... I wanted it to remain beside the row and not be centered on the Row + Row Details.\n \nTo do this, simple define a setter property in your RowHeaderStyle definition:\n \n        <Style x:Key=\"RowHeaderStyle\" TargetType=\"{x:Type wpftoolkit:DataGridRowHeader}\">\n            <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"#A1A1A1\"/>\n            <Setter Property=\"VerticalAlignment\" Value=\"Top\"/>    \n        </Style>",
