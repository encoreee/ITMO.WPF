    "Description": "Hello\n \nWhen right clicking the window icon in a ribbonwindow the system menu shows up the same way as if it was left clicked. This is different from a normal window where right clicking the window icon causes the same effect as if there was a right click in the non client area. Also at this moment the system menu shows up on the rightmousedown event where it should be rightmouseup like other windows.\n \nTo see this is very simple. You can just run one of the sample you get together with the source code and compare it to a normal wpf window or win32 window.",
