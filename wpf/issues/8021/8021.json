    "Description": "I downloaded the latest Oct 27 2008 version on WPF toolkit and ran into issue while sizing the DataGrid column. The scenario is, Set AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" and define your own DataGrid Column as following.\n<dg:DataGrid.Columns>\n    <dg:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"First Name\" Width=\"SizeToCells\" IsReadOnly=\"True\" \n                                          Binding=\"{Binding Path=FirstName}\" />\n    <dg:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Middle Name\" Width=\"100\" IsReadOnly=\"True\" \n                                          Binding=\"{Binding Path=MiddleName}\" />\n    <dg:DataGridTextColumn Header=\"Last Name\" Width=\"SizeToHeader\" IsReadOnly=\"True\" \n                                          Binding=\"{Binding Path=LastName}\" />\n</dg:DataGrid.Columns>\n \nNote the width property settings. Now when i have data available (i.e., have some rows to display), resizing any columns has no issue. But when there is no rows to be shown (Usually in initial stage) the Grid displays the column header, but resizing results in an exception. This happens for the column with Width=\"SizeToCells\" setting. \n \nI was not able to simulate this issue in the older version (Dated: Aug 11 2008).",
