    "Description": "If the datagrid is hosted in a scrollviewer and if the scroll viewer does not have Focusable=\"False\" when the current cell is clicked on the scrollviewer receives the focus. This is demonstrated i the attached project.\n \nThe behaviour that i am expecting is that if i click on the CurrentCell, it stays the CurrentCell.\n \nI use the ControlPanel->Ease of Access Center-> Make the keyboard easier to use->Underline keyboard shortcuts and access keys\nThis enables one to see where the keyboard focus is, as with this setting set there is a dotted line around the currently focused element.",
