    "Description": "Hi,\n \nWe are trying to make the chart movable in a drag drop manner. \nThe drag drop operation involves an remove and insertat operation to shift its location in the collection. \nThis process appears to reset the AxisOrientation dp on the axes collection to None. \nThis causes the location to be evaluated as Auto\nThis causes an exception on the next render as the rendering code needs to know where the axis will be located.\n \nThe drag drop works if no axes are configured in xaml (as it auto creates them) but if there are custom ones their properties appear to be undone by the Drag Drop operation.\n \nHas anyone seen this behavior before or have any suggestions to fixing it?\n \nCheers",
