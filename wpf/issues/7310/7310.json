      "Message": "Hi flatliner60,\r\n\r\nUnforunately the default sort is handled on the UI thread, which is why you're seeing this behavior.  We agree that it would be better to do on a background thread, so we've filed this suggestion in our internal database for a future release.  In the meantime, you may be interested in implementing a custom sort which runs on a background thread.  You can find instructions for implementing custom sort here: http://www.codeplex.com/wpf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Custom%20Sort&referringTitle=Tips%20%26%20Tricks.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nSamantha",
