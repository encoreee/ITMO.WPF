    "Description": "Hi! I am trying to implement a custom editor for dates to use it in a propertygrid.\nMy DatePickerEditor worked fine until I tried to set the IsEnabled state through binding:\n \n<TK:DatePicker x:Name=\"PART_editor\"\n                       SelectedDate=\"{Binding Value, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}\"\n                       IsEnabled=\"{Binding IsEditable}\" />\n \nDid that for a custom string editor as well and there it worked without problems. But for the Datepicker I am getting an exeption I don't really understand:\nThe Name \"PART_DisabledVisual\" could not be found in namespace \"System.Windows.Controls.Grid\".\nWhy is he trying to use grid there?",
