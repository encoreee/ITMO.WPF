    "Description": "I'm using expression blend 4 with wpftoolkit v3.5.50211.1 and when I try to create a copy template of the accordion control it causes expression blend to exit with an error. I have created a resource dictionary in  a folder called styles and named in accordion.xaml and choose to save the  copy in this file. I've attached screen scrapes to show the steps that I've went through.",
