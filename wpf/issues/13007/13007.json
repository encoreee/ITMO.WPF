    "Description": "Hi, I found a strange issue using the same ItemsSource to two different DataGrids\n \nLets say, Page_A has a DataGrid with CanUserAddRow setted to True (default)\nPage_B has a DataGrid with CanUserAddRow setted to False\n \nBoth DataGrid uses the same ItemsSource, an ObservableCollection.\n \nWhen loading page A, the datagrid allows to add row.\nThen, changing to page B, the datagrid does not allow to add row, as desired.\nBut, when chaging again to page A, the datagrid doesn't allow to add rows anymore...\n \nI had to set different ItemsSource to each grid to avoid this issue...\n \nAny suggestion?",
