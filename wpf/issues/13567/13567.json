    "Description": "Hello\nWe like open source projects to help developing software. Of course, this concept only works,\nif the repository (most of the time) can be compiled and has all it's build files.\n \nUnfortunately, the WPF Toolkit source from the repository:\n- does not  compile (there are descriptions how to make it buildable)... why are these fixes not in the repository?\n- the setup project is completely missing\n- the build files are missing:\n  - ... for creating strong assemblies\n  - ... for creating the final dll's\n \nI'm very sorry, but with such an incomplete repository it is *very* discouraging to work for it, especially because\nthere are cheked out project copies, which solves all these problems and would allow just to provide bug\nfixes or add ons.\n \nWe would appreciate it very much if codeplex projects are completely open source so that they can\nbe bug fixed, extended, ...\n \nKind regards,Thomas",
