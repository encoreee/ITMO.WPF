    "Description": "Hi all, sorry If this has been covered before but I am having trouble with the refreshing of the WPF Chart controls from System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit.\n\nI have an collection of Point objects that is bound as the itemssource to the chart.  on first load the data displays perfect.\n\n\n\nI then replace this collection with a new collection of point (data is modified in the database and reloaded) and fire the PropertyChanged call for the collection property and the graph goes strange.\n\n\n\nThe datapoints are in the correct place but the line is drawn offset from these.  If I put a call in the code behind as\n            lSeries.ItemsSource = null;\n            lSeries.ItemsSource = ViewModel.SelectedForecast.ForecastData;\n\nit redraws the graph properly, but i don't want the user to have to click something to get the data showing correct.  if you shut the application and reload it displays properly again.\n\nanyone seen this behaviour before or have any thoughts on best way to solve. I would prefer not to have the user have to do anything and the logic for reloading etc is all in the viewmodel.\n\n\ncheers\n\nandy",
