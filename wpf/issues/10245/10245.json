    "Description": "Hi,\n    I have a display text in ComboBox is a concatenated string from database table. The concatenated string composed of two columns (e.g. column1 (char(50)) + ' ' + column2) looks fine in SQL client. However it is messed up in ComboBox.  Obviously it's caused by different Character width. Is there any way to make those aligned nicely?",
