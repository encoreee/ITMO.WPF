    "Description": "With a ComboBox, one can use a CompositeCollection to merge different Collections and use ItemsSource to show them.\nAs long as the Items provide a ToString()-Function that returns the String the item's DataTemplate displays, even the AutoCompletion-Feature of a simple ComboBox (IsTextSearchEnabled-Property) works as expected.\n \nThe AutoCompleteBox provided here (WPF Toolkit February 2010 Release) seems not to work with CompositeCollections at all. The Items covered by a CollectionContainer cannot be found... Instead it lets you complete \"Sys\" to \"System.Windows.Data.CollectionContainer\" ;)\n \nThis is also discussed here:\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/baafbb04-68e9-4c86-b4bd-61067f8a437b?prof=required&ppud=4\n \nThe attached VS2010 Beta 1 file allows you to compare the behavior of a ComboBox with the AutoCompleteBox.\n \n- dartrax",

      "Message": "Thanks for reporting this issue, and for taking the time to include a repro project, that definitely helps! For the time being, this is unfortunately \"by design\" as the AutoCompleteBox included in the WPF Toolkit is based almost entirely on the SL version. I do realize this should work though, and I will be contacting the control's owner to see if it's feasible to get it fixed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPatrick",
