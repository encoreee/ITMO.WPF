    "Description": "This relates to the custom themes - not the wpf toolkit itself, but since the themes seems to be a subproject released under this, as far as I can tell this is the best place to post this.\n \nBasically the initial visual state of checkboxes and radio buttons when they have IsChecked set to true is wrong - they do *not* display a check or radio button as they should.\n \nFor more details, see the following posting:\n \nhttp://wpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=58152\n \nRegards,\nPhil",
