    "Description": "I'm using Visual Studio 2010 Beta and I'm having trouble loading the dll for the ribbon controls.  It says that it cannot load the ribbon in the errors list and I can't figure out why. Is it an issue with VS 2010 or a possible problem with the dll?  It does work in Expression Blend 3 so I'm assuming maybe it's a compatibility issue with 2010.  Any help or guidance to remedy the situation would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks",
