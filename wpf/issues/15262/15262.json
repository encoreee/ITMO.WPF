    "Description": "Hello,\nÂ \nI downloaded WPF toolkit from officeui website. I download your lab and i just opened Ribbon Ex 2 solution in VS 2010.\nI LITERALLY get can't resolve symbol at every possible line in window1.xaml.\nI read about how ribboncommand should be replaced by ribbonbutton to make it work, etc, etc. It's simply\nTOO much to search around and make it work so that i could use your product in my project.\nWHY is that so? Do you even care about your releases?",
