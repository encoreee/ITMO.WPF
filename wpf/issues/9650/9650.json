    "Description": "Similar as Issue # 9259. (So I explicitely vote for that too, since I made that same adjustment.)\nWhen the user pushes f.e. a Commit or Cancel button, the current cell - with possibly invalid input - looses focus, but simply cannot leave editmode (in either ways).\nI do not use commands there, and all my editable columns/cells are templated columns.\nDid also not test this with the march release. From some dry testing I concluded that it must work in the same way.\nMy current - copy and paste - solution in a attachment.\nÂ \nGreetings Eric Gehring \nwww.softex.nl",

      "Message": "Hi brandf,\r\n\r\nIt is not exactly the same - other part of the code (other method). \r\nThe similarity however is that there isn't a current cell. So when you succeed in a solution preventing that from occurring, you are right. So current cell would in that case be the (last) active cell. \"My attached solution\" (maybe workaround is a better phrase) alternatively searches for the row being edited. I added a simple ugly copied-pasted \"else\" for that.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nEric Gehring\r\nwww.softex.nl",
