    "Description": "The June 2009 Release and Changeset 28036 don't build for me. There are 73 build errors in the Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit.Design project and 11 errors in the Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit.Expression project. I'm using VS 2008 SP1 (.NET framework 3.5 SP1 etc) on Win7 RC0 x64. I haven't changed any of the project or solution settings. I also have VS 2010 beta 1 installed, but haven't tried the solution in there. Is anyone else having build issues like this? Are there CI builds that run over this stuff so I can tell if it is just me?",

Unlike their Visual Studio counterparts, these design-time assemblies are not automatically found by the build and their absence causes 84 build errors in the Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit.Design and Controls.DataVisualization.Toolkit.Expression.Design projects. :(\r\n\r\nMost people won't care about building the Blend-specific design-time assemblies and can simply right-click the two failing projects in Visual Studio and choose \"Unload Project\". After that, everything builds successfully. \r\n\r\nLooks like this is \"by design\".",
