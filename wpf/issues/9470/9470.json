Because of this issue (http://wpf.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=9442) I added DataContext=\"{x:Null}\" to all my Calendar tests and later switched to a different kind of binding which relies on inherited datacontext. No wonder it showed January, 0001 :-)\r\n\r\nCan someone please remove this issue, because it's too embarrassing to keep it public ;-)",
